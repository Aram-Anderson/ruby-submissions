_Please choose the score you think you've earned in each category below. Please also describe why you feel you've earned this score for each section!_

### 1. Project Planning & Management

*   4: Developer has a highly detailed iteration map, sophisticated organization in their tracker tool, and exceptional Git workflow
*   3: Developer uses an iteration map to plan project scope, breaks down broad features into granular tasks, and exercises good Git workflow (e.g., feature branches, descriptive commits, incremental PRs)
*   2: Developer has a mental vision for the project iterations, shows some use of a tracker tool, and uses Git effectively
*   1: Developer shows little evidence of project planning and management

3: I used waffle to manage the tasks that I wanted to do and add tasks or chores that I wanted to complete as I saw fit. I commited regularly, and make descriptive commit messages. 

### 2. Completion & Pace

*   4: Developer delivers the stories they committed to before starting the sprint
*   3: Developer plans stories ahead of sprint and makes some scope adjustments along the way
*   2: Developer implements very little of the planned sprint
*   1: Developer does not plan or complete sprint

2: I didn't do anything with my frontend. 

### 3. Implementation Quality

*   4: Project demonstrates exceptionally well tested (where applicable) and maintainable code
      * for topics outside of BE curriculum, developer can speak to best practices applied
*   3: Project exhibits tested (where applicable), maintainable, and well-organized code. Developer can speak to architecture and implementation decisions
*   2: Project demonstrates some gaps in code quality and/or developers cannot defend their decisions
*   1: Project demonstrates poor factoring and/or understanding of general programming principles such as MVC and OOP

3: Everything in my backend was well tested. I installed simple cov and have coverage over 98 percent. I was able to make changes relatively easy within my exisiting infractructure. 

### 4. Application of Techniques

*   4: Developer builds project in a new language(s) or framework(s)
*   3: Developer implements four new techniques or patterns
*   2: Developer implements 3 or less major techniques that have not been previously attempted
*   1: Developer does not implement new techniques

2: Since I did not get to the front end portion I only used Google Cloud SDK, GS bucket, and Google Vision API. 

### 5. Documentation

*   4: Developer also adds a screencast, tutorial or other wow factor
*   3: Developer provides easy to navigate documentation showing how to setup and contribute to the application
*   2: Developer provides barebones documentation showing how to get the dev environment up and running
*   1: Developer provides insufficient documentation

2: I did not refactor my read me. 
### 6. Accessibility

*   4: Developer expertly implements features to follow accessibility best practices
