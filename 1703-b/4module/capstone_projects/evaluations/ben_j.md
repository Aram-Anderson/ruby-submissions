_Please choose the score you think you've earned in each category below. Please also describe why you feel you've earned this score for each section!_

### 1. Project Planning & Management

*   4: Developer has a highly detailed iteration map, sophisticated organization in their tracker tool, and exceptional Git workflow
*   **3: Developer uses an iteration map to plan project scope, breaks down broad features into granular tasks, and exercises good Git workflow (e.g., feature branches, descriptive commits, incremental PRs)**
*   2: Developer has a mental vision for the project iterations, shows some use of a tracker tool, and uses Git effectively
*   1: Developer shows little evidence of project planning and management

This project required an extremely agile approach based on the complexity of interacting with so many difference external services. I believe that I came up with a good plan and managed the project effectively from an internal perspective but there is always room for improvement for me here.

### 2. Completion & Pace

*   4: Developer delivers the stories they committed to before starting the sprint
*   **3: Developer plans stories ahead of sprint and makes some scope adjustments along the way**
*   2: Developer implements very little of the planned sprint
*   1: Developer does not plan or complete sprint

I'd like to give myself a four here for what I was able to accomplish in the amount of time I was able to work on the project, but given the nature of the four I would have to say that I under delivered in terms of what I had hoped to accomplish. With only three services working and no user dashboard I suppose I fell short but adjusted along the way.

### 3. Implementation Quality

*   **4: Project demonstrates exceptionally well tested (where applicable) and maintainable code
      * for topics outside of BE curriculum, developer can speak to best practices applied**
*   3: Project exhibits tested (where applicable), maintainable, and well-organized code. Developer can speak to architecture and implementation decisions
*   2: Project demonstrates some gaps in code quality and/or developers cannot defend their decisions
*   1: Project demonstrates poor factoring and/or understanding of general programming principles such as MVC and OOP

My code is well encapsulated and well tested, especially considering the difficulty of testing so many externally dependent interactions. I created multiple poros and service objects that keep functionality separated and allow for easy maintainence and further development.

### 4. Application of Techniques

*   4: Developer builds project in a new language(s) or framework(s)
*   **3: Developer implements four new techniques or patterns**
*   2: Developer implements 3 or less major techniques that have not been previously attempted
*   1: Developer does not implement new techniques

I would say 3.5. I'm using sockets and a separate Express server for realtime application, and I'm using Vue.js for my entire front end. Not to mention incorporating 3 services with all their complex interfacing. 

### 5. Documentation

*   4: Developer also adds a screencast, tutorial or other wow factor
*   **3: Developer provides easy to navigate documentation showing how to setup and contribute to the application**
*   2: Developer provides barebones documentation showing how to get the dev environment up and running
*   1: Developer provides insufficient documentation

I wrote a good readme showing how I one could set up this complex development environment. And it has pictures. And a travis badge.

### 6. Accessibility

*   4: Developer expertly implements features to follow accessibility best practices**
*   **3: Developer implements code to increase accessibility**
*   2: Developer considers accessibility issues but has not yet produced code to address them
*   1: Developer does not consider accessibility issues

I used title tags and tabindex. I practiced with a screen reader to make sure.
