_Please choose the score you think you've earned in each category below. Please also describe why you feel you've earned this score for each section!_

### 1. Project Planning & Management

*   3: **Developer uses an iteration map to plan project scope, breaks down broad features into granular tasks, and exercises good Git workflow (e.g., feature branches, descriptive commits, incremental PRs)**
I'm giving myself a 3 because I think I've done a good job planning the project, meeting with and implementing client needs and stories, and keeping very detailed PRs including asking for reviews on important PRs.

### 2. Completion & Pace

*   3: **Developer plans stories ahead of sprint and makes some scope adjustments along the way**
I'm giving myself a three because I'm pretty much where I though I'd be at this point. When I first took this project on it was agreed that I'd actually continue to work on this after the due date. I have a very detailed story list on Waffle and have been working with Turing staff as clients and adjusting accordingly.

### 3. Implementation Quality

*   3: **Project exhibits tested (where applicable), maintainable, and well-organized code. Developer can speak to architecture and implementation decisions**
I spent a lot of time oganizing my React components to be as modular as possible. I could talk for many minutes on why I chose to do the things I did, esspecially with Error handling, API access, and how Rails and React integrate.

### 4. Application of Techniques

*   **3: Developer implements four new techniques or patterns**
I'm giving myself a 3 becuase while I've only implemented 3 new techniques, I have another few I'm prepared to implement. I have used React for the frontend, JWT security for authorizing and authenticating users accessing the API, and Phantomjs for testing React. To come is auto emailing and messaging.

### 5. Documentation

*   3: **Developer provides easy to navigate documentation showing how to setup and contribute to the application**
I have updated my readme as I went trying to make my code as accessible as possible to whomever inherits it. It's not really aimed at some random person cloning it, but at future Turing folks who will be using it.

### 6. Accessibility

*   4: Developer expertly implements features to follow accessibility best practices
*   3: Developer implements code to increase accessibility
*   2: Developer considers accessibility issues but has not yet produced code to address them
*   1: Developer does not consider accessibility issues

### Evaluated By: Schutte

### Notes:

### 1. Project Planning & Management

*   **3: Developer uses an iteration map to plan project scope, breaks down broad features into granular tasks, and exercises good Git workflow (e.g., feature branches, descriptive commits, incremental PRs)**

Met a lot with Simon and Joanne to figure out the roadmap. Took longer than
expected, but worth the extra time. Meeting with Simon at least once per week.

### 2. Completion & Pace

*   **3: Developer plans stories ahead of sprint and makes some scope adjustments along the way**

### 3. Implementation Quality

*   **3: Project exhibits tested (where applicable), maintainable, and well-organized code. Developer can speak to architecture and implementation decisions**

Broken production/staging site. Good use of modules for shared behavior. Testing
key features, using Travis. Priority on security.

### 4. Application of Techniques

*   **4: Developer builds project in a new language(s) or framework(s)**

* React/Rails gem and JwT.

### 5. Documentation

*   **4: Developer also adds a screencast, tutorial or other wow factor**

Super thorough. Code snippets, quotes, detailed.

### 6. Accessibility

*   **3: Developer implements code to increase accessibility**

Semantic HTML, keeping the view and interface simple and organized (easy to
    navigate).

Two future goals: making it tab-able and screenread-able. Keeping devices in
mind for the future. Has CSS set up for media queries.
