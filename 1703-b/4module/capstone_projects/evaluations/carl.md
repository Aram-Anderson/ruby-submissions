### 1. Project Planning & Management

**   4: Developer has a highly detailed iteration map, sophisticated organization in their tracker tool, and exceptional Git workflow **

+ A lot of the research I did with regards to my statistical model was in Excel, so I don't have many commits to demonstrate that work, but I feel I have great git workflow for my front and backend. 


### 2. Completion & Pace

**   4: Developer delivers the stories they committed to before starting the sprint **

+ I set out to make a program that would categorize emails and write a research paper on it. I accomplished both those tasks. 


### 3. Implementation Quality

**   4: Project demonstrates exceptionally well tested (where applicable) and maintainable code
      * for topics outside of BE curriculum, developer can speak to best practices applied **
      
 + I have a 7 page research paper on the best practices used in my project. 

### 4. Application of Techniques

**   4: Developer builds project in a new language(s) or framework(s) **

+ I used a React frontend and expanded my knowledge in statistics. 


### 5. Documentation

**   4: Developer also adds a screencast, tutorial or other wow factor **

+ If there is one thing you can't fault me on in this project is documentation. 


### 6. Accessibility

*   2: Developer considers accessibility issues but has not yet produced code to address them

+ I really wanted to make accessible via screen readers, but I didn't have the time to make it as user friendly as I would have liked. I tried to add alt text to all my components, but fell short in covering all of them.
