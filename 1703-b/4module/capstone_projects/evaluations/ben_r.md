_Please choose the score you think you've earned in each category below. Please also describe why you feel you've earned this score for each section!_

### 1. Project Planning & Management

*   4: Developer has a highly detailed iteration map, sophisticated organization in their tracker tool, and exceptional Git workflow
**3: Developer uses an iteration map to plan project scope, breaks down broad features into granular tasks, and exercises good Git workflow (e.g., feature branches, descriptive commits, incremental PRs)

I had a very different approach for this project. I wrote out a two phase iteration map and generally followed that pretty closely. Where I deviated was the granularity in which I wrote my user stories. This project was in part a brainstorming session to develop a concept that I'd like to take further. I did map out features I thought I wanted, and had satisfactory git workflow to support them and organize my workflow. 

*   2: Developer has a mental vision for the project iterations, shows some use of a tracker tool, and uses Git effectively
*   1: Developer shows little evidence of project planning and management

### 2. Completion & Pace

*   4: Developer delivers the stories they committed to before starting the sprint
**3: Developer plans stories ahead of sprint and makes some scope adjustments along the way

I followed my two major iterations very well. The first was primarily building the backend, and while it was largely a spike, I completed what I wanted and moved on my the date I intended. I didn't have the vision to plan enough detail to create user stories, but I had a working wireframe that I was constantly updating to help me hone the vision that I had. 

*   2: Developer implements very little of the planned sprint
*   1: Developer does not plan or complete sprint

### 3. Implementation Quality

*   4: Project demonstrates exceptionally well tested (where applicable) and maintainable code
      * for topics outside of BE curriculum, developer can speak to best practices applied
**3: Project exhibits tested (where applicable), maintainable, and well-organized code. Developer can speak to architecture and implementation decisions

I have solid test coverage, above 90%. The code is not the most organized thing I've ever written. I didn't find the time to refactor like I would have. One controller action in particular has a lot of instance variables. My presenter that I intended to use was being used by another controller, the complexity would have taken a long time to sort out. But overall, I have a decent architecture. 

*   2: Project demonstrates some gaps in code quality and/or developers cannot defend their decisions
*   1: Project demonstrates poor factoring and/or understanding of general programming principles such as MVC and OOP

### 4. Application of Techniques

*   4: Developer builds project in a new language(s) or framework(s)
**3: Developer implements four new techniques or patterns

Google map with pins, background worker while climate profile is being created, statistics being used to generate climate, charts js to generate visual description of climates. 

*   2: Developer implements 3 or less major techniques that have not been previously attempted
*   1: Developer does not implement new techniques

### 5. Documentation

*   4: Developer also adds a screencast, tutorial or other wow factor
**3: Developer provides easy to navigate documentation showing how to setup and contribute to the application

Well supported documentation. 

*   2: Developer provides barebones documentation showing how to get the dev environment up and running
*   1: Developer provides insufficient documentation

### 6. Accessibility

*   4: Developer expertly implements features to follow accessibility best practices
**3: Developer implements code to increase accessibility

I tabbed throught the application, and it seems that the links are in logical order. Images are supported with alt tags. Where visuals aren't supported by alt tags, title tags are used instead. 

*   2: Developer considers accessibility issues but has not yet produced code to address them
*   1: Developer does not consider accessibility issues
