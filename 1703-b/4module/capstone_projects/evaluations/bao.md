_Please choose the score you think you've earned in each category below. Please also describe why you feel you've earned this score for each section!_

### 1. Project Planning & Management

*   4: Developer has a highly detailed iteration map, sophisticated organization in their tracker tool, and exceptional Git workflow
#####   3: Developer uses an iteration map to plan project scope, breaks down broad features into granular tasks, and exercises good Git workflow (e.g., feature branches, descriptive commits, incremental PRs)
*   2: Developer has a mental vision for the project iterations, shows some use of a tracker tool, and uses Git effectively
*   1: Developer shows little evidence of project planning and management


I used Waffle.io to build user stories and track task management. I also used feature branches, and made detailed pull requests to summarized changes to the code. 

### 2. Completion & Pace

*   4: Developer delivers the stories they committed to before starting the sprint
#####   3: Developer plans stories ahead of sprint and makes some scope adjustments along the way
*   2: Developer implements very little of the planned sprint
*   1: Developer does not plan or complete sprint

I think I planned very well and did complete the minimum product. I wanted to build a faster, recursive algorithm, but I didn't have time for that. I also had to make a very simplified weather feature on the front end. It took a bit longer to debug the problems I encountered in React.

### 3. Implementation Quality

*   4: Project demonstrates exceptionally well tested (where applicable) and maintainable code
      * for topics outside of BE curriculum, developer can speak to best practices applied
#####   3: Project exhibits tested (where applicable), maintainable, and well-organized code. Developer can speak to architecture and implementation decisions
*   2: Project demonstrates some gaps in code quality and/or developers cannot defend their decisions
*   1: Project demonstrates poor factoring and/or understanding of general programming principles such as MVC and OOP

I think I did both ends as well organized and well coded as I could do in the time that I have. I initially had much stronger testing in the back end, but my tests were broken because of my autofiltering that I do. I have to mock and stub the tests for them to pass.

### 4. Application of Techniques

*   4: Developer builds project in a new language(s) or framework(s)
#####   3: Developer implements four new techniques or patterns
*   2: Developer implements 3 or less major techniques that have not been previously attempted
*   1: Developer does not implement new techniques

I built the front end in React, which is new, but the backend was in Rails. I thought I was going to have time to implement a new technique in the back with mailers, but I didn't have time for that. Without those feature sets, I probably should have built the back in some other framework like Express because I don't think it would have taken any longer.

### 5. Documentation

*   4: Developer also adds a screencast, tutorial or other wow factor
#####   3: Developer provides easy to navigate documentation showing how to setup and contribute to the application
*   2: Developer provides barebones documentation showing how to get the dev environment up and running
*   1: Developer provides insufficient documentation

Both projects have readmes. The front end simply shows how to get the project running in development, and details why the project exists. The backend is more detailed, to describe all the endpoints and use of the API.

### 6. Accessibility

*   4: Developer expertly implements features to follow accessibility best practices
*   3: Developer implements code to increase accessibility
#####   2: Developer considers accessibility issues but has not yet produced code to address them
*   1: Developer does not consider accessibility issues

I didn't not have time to test out accessibility problems. I don't think the front end has any problems with color, with my testing but I didn't not try to navigate the website with the keyboard.
