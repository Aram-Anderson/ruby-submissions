### Full Circle

### Pitch

Full Circle aims to automate and streamline the diversity scholarship program at Turing. 

### Problem

Reviewers get between 9 and 15 essays to review. These are uploaded by students as PDF or Word Docs then photocopied for each reviewer by a Turing staff. Each reviewer then marks a sheet the scores and hands them over to an Admin who tallies the scores, sends e-mails, and tracks followups. This process is 

### Solution

An app will allow for tighter user authorization, ensure anonymous submissions, make reviewing applications simple to complete and track, allow admins to track reviewing progress, present aggregate information, and automate reminders, responses, and follow up emails.

### Target Audience

The target audience is both the Students and the Faculty at Turing.

### New Techniques

I'll be using React as the front end. Automated e-mailing and background workers will be needed. The other big challenge will be working on a product that needs to 'ship' by end of the window. This will require me to think very hard about Agile dev and making an unfinished but usable product.

### Workflow

Aside from Github, I'll be using Waffle to manage user stories. I'm using this so my 'client' can track progress from the Github repo instead of needing to also look at the project tracker.
