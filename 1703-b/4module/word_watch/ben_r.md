## Self Assessment Rubric

*Of "Above", "Meets", and "Below" expectations, describe why you deserve which one.*

### 1. Completion:
  * At a minimum, developer completes challenges 1-3.

Above Expectations

**Meets Expectations

I completed all the challenges. I am choosing not to assess myself as above expectations because there was at least one bug that I noticed. If the paragraph I submitted was very long, then it would split into multiple paragraphs, each on being analyzed separately so words would appear multiple times. 

Below Expectations

### 2. Code quality
  * Developer breaks functions out into separate responsibilities for:
    * DOM manipulation
    * API interactions
    * data processing
  * Developer has no functions that exceed 8 lines.
  * Developer uses `Array.prototype` functions over `for` loops where appropriate.
  * Developer deals with async API requests in a readable, coherent way.

Above Expectations

**Meets Expectations

I felt that I broke my functions down into single responsibilities fairly well. My functions are short. I did however use for loops and didn't deal with Async scenarios.

Below Expectations

### 3. Events and DOM manipulation
  * Developer resgisters event listeners within `document.ready`.
  * Developer targets nodes/elements cleanly using 1 or 2 css selectors.
    * && without heavy use of traversing parents and/or children.

Above Expectations

**Meets Expectations

I felt that I was effective with and readable with DOM manipulation targeting the nodes that I was trying to listen for or manipulate. 

Below Expectations

### 4. JS conventions
  * Developer scopes variables appropriately.
  * Developer has consistent use of `var` OR `const` and `let`.
  * Developer has consistent use or non-use of semicolons.
  * Developer has consistent use of function syntax.
    * ...or can speak to why inconsistencies were necessary.
  * Developer names variables using camelCase.
  * Developer names classes and constructor functions using CapitalizedCamelCased.

Above Expectations

**Meets Expectations

I felt I kept the same flavor of tofu throughout my code. I consistently used ES5 syntax and didn't stray to ES6. I consistently don't use simicolons. I use camelCase throughout. I scoped variables correctly.
