## Self Assessment Rubric

*Of "Above", "Meets", and "Below" expectations, describe why you deserve which one.*

### 1. Completion:
  * At a minimum, developer completes challenges 1-3.

**Above Expectations** I did them all

### 2. Code quality
  * Developer breaks functions out into separate responsibilities for:
    * DOM manipulation
    * API interactions
    * data processing
  * Developer has no functions that exceed 8 lines.
  * Developer uses `Array.prototype` functions over `for` loops where appropriate.
  * Developer deals with async API requests in a readable, coherent way.

**Above Expectations** I respect SRP, I have separate functions for DOM manipulation, API, appending to html, etc. None of my functions exceed 8 lines. I used map and reduce when appropriate, used for loops when I didn't want to return an array and I chose for loops instead of forEach because it is faster.

### 3. Events and DOM manipulation
  * Developer resgisters event listeners within `document.ready`.
  * Developer targets nodes/elements cleanly using 1 or 2 css selectors.
    * && without heavy use of traversing parents and/or children.

**Above Expectations** It is within document.ready and I added classes to avoid traversing children.

### 4. JS conventions
  * Developer scopes variables appropriately.
  * Developer has consistent use of `var` OR `const` and `let`.
  * Developer has consistent use or non-use of semicolons.
  * Developer has consistent use of function syntax.
    * ...or can speak to why inconsistencies were necessary.
  * Developer names variables using camelCase.
  * Developer names classes and constructor functions using CapitalizedCamelCased.

**Above Expectations** I did all of them and even used classes. The only es6 style I didn't use was fat arrows because I used a reduce and didn't know how the syntax would change; so to avoid problems (time constraint) I didn't use them.

**Meets Expectations**

You already do a great job hiding implementation details from the document ready listener, so this bit: https://github.com/nmcolome/word_watch/blob/master/src/index.js#L8-L12 is inconsistent.

For "Above", we'd like to see things like separating out different scopes of
functionality. E.g., an API service class, and DOM manipulation class, etc.

Great job! You wrote very clean code üëç
