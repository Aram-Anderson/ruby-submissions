Above Expectations

**Meets Expectations**

Below Expectations

### 2. Code quality
  * Developer breaks functions out into separate responsibilities for:
    * DOM manipulation
    * API interactions
    * data processing

**Above Expectations**

Meets Expectations

Below Expectations

### 3. Events and DOM manipulation

## Rubric

## Notes:

- Your `Counter` class is really nice for separating out all that logic to one class with many methods
- `service.js` is also another highlight of your submission. I love the maleability of it
- I feel like you could have taken more advantage of `html.js`. I love that you created it, so I think more logic could be pushed there.
- I'm a little confused by your manager's `listen` method only calling `textSubmissionListener`. I'm guessing it's in the event of the application scaling to handle more types of events, but where it stands, `listen()` seems unnecessary
- I have similar feelings about `loader.js` initializing `app.js`. I'm sure this would be lovely if the app were to scale up, but it leads to a bit of confusion when getting oriented with the codebase
