I target things that I want to. I changed some of the names in the HTML to target the button I wanted. I had event listeners for when a button was clicked. 

Below Expectations

  * Developer has consistent use of `var` OR `const` and `let`.

Used decent amount of ES6 syntax. Prefer to use const over var. I do not use semicolons. 
I don't think I used much fat arrow syntax. 
Used Camel Case properly.
