## Self Assessment Rubric

*Of "Above", "Meets", and "Below" expectations, describe why you deserve which one.*

### 1. Completion:

+ Touched on every user story.
**Meets Expectations**

### 2. Code quality
  * Developer breaks functions out into separate responsibilities for:
    * DOM manipulation
    * API interactions
    * data processing
  * Developer has no functions that exceed 8 lines.
  * Developer uses `Array.prototype` functions over `for` loops where appropriate.
  * Developer deals with async API requests in a readable, coherent way.

+ I think I met the expectations of the test, breaking out responsibility for API and data manipulations, although I could have broken it down further and seperated dom manipulation into it's own class. 
+ I think I wrote the API requests in a readable, coherent way.
+ I think I could have followed OOP principles more closely, as I do not pass around classes (in the ruby sense). My aim was to meet the functional expectations of the assignment first and refactor later and I think I could refactor this code to be very clean with time. 
**Meets Expectations**


### 3. Events and DOM manipulation
  * Developer resgisters event listeners within `document.ready`.
  * Developer targets nodes/elements cleanly using 1 or 2 css selectors.
    * && without heavy use of traversing parents and/or children.

+ I think I contained all my event listeners within `document.ready` and didn't used more than 2 css selectors at a time.
**Meets Expectations**

### 4. JS conventions
  * Developer scopes variables appropriately.
  * Developer has consistent use of `var` OR `const` and `let`.
  * Developer has consistent use or non-use of semicolons.
  * Developer has consistent use of function syntax.
    * ...or can speak to why inconsistencies were necessary.
  * Developer names variables using camelCase.
  * Developer names classes and constructor functions using CapitalizedCamelCased.

+ I think I followed JS convention for the most part and was consistent in not using semicolons.
+ I believe I have some mix of Jquery and raw JS, which could be refactored to be more consistent.
**Meets Expectations**
