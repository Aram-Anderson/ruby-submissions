Notes:
* working plus extension
* 18 tests
* Runner files contain too much logic
* Depends on instance variables to share information - think of methods as sending and receiving messages
* File IO should be pulled out

Rubric:

### 1. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 2: Application makes use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient


### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application consistently breaks concepts into classes and methods which have appropriate scope and responsibilities (SRP).

### 4. Functional Expectations

* 4: Application meets all requirements, and implements one extension properly.
