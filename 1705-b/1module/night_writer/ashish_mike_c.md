Notes: 

* Limited night read tests.
* Practice the pattern of methods sending and receiving messages to each other rather than modifying a single instance variable.
* All code files should go in the lib directory
* Alphabet class needs some tests - all classes should have a test file, all methods should have at least one test.
* Application fully functional - minor bug where output text counts line breaks.

Rubric:


### 1. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 2: Application makes use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient


### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application consistently breaks concepts into classes and methods which have appropriate scope and responsibilities (SRP).

### 4. Functional Expectations

* 3: Application meets all requirements as laid out per the specification.
