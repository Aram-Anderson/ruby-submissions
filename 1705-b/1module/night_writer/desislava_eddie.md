Translates from English to Braille and back

Multiple test files, converter test is broken down into incremental tests  
Multiple errors when running the test files

One super long method in Converter, but were able to speak to how they wanted to refactor this  

Rubric:

### 1. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 2: Application makes use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application consistently breaks concepts into classes and methods which have appropriate scope and responsibilities (SRP).

### 4. Functional Expectations

* 3: Application meets all requirements as laid out per the specification.
