Notes:

* 24 tests, all passing
* Completed including load
* used smart node_approach
* Some opportunties to refactor, some repetitiion in conditionals
* FileIO should be pulled out of node to another class

Rubric:

### 1. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

### 4. Functional Expectations

* 2: Application runs, but does not work properly, or does not meet specifications.
