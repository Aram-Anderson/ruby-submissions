Notes:  
Started Iter 4  
Tried using fixtures, but it caused problems with answers off, so switched back to data set  
Testing:
Talked through unit vs integration examples  
Testing individual components as broke out methods  
Talked about how much TDD helped them trace errors  
140 assertions  
98% coverage  
1108s to run  
Ruby & Style:  
map, find_all, some reduce  
Talked about breaking things apart to appease Law of Demeter  
Could improve readability of variable names  i.e. ir for invoice_repository  


### 1. Fundamental Ruby & Style

*   3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

### 2. Breaking Logic into Components

*   3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

### 3. Test-Driven Development

*   3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

### 4. Functional Expectations

*   2: Application implements iterations 0, 1, 2, and 3

### 5. Code Sanitation

The output from `rake sanitation:all` shows...

*   4: Zero complaints
