Notes:

Rubric:

### 1. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 2:  Application runs but the code has long methods, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and needs significant refactoring

### 2. Looping *or* Recursion

* 1: Application struggles to loop/recurse at all

### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 2: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient

### 4. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 1: Application logic shows poor decomposition with too much logic mashed together

### 5. Functional Expectations

* 2: Application runs, but does not work properly, or does not meet specifications.
