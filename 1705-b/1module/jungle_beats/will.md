Notes:
Working through mid iter 4   
24 test, all passing  
Methods are fairly clean, some opportunities for refactoring for SRP

Rubric:

### 1. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

### 2. Looping *or* Recursion

* 3: Application makes effective use of loop/recursion techniques

### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

### 4. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

### 5. Functional Expectations

* 2: Application runs, but does not work properly, or does not meet specifications.
