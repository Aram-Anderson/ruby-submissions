Notes:

7 all passing  
Working toward breaking things down into smaller methods  
Areas for refactoring and pulling functionality out for methods  
Used multiple classes that made sense, still working on tying pieces together    
REPL prints welcome message, but nothing beyond that  

Rubric:

### 1. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 2:  Application runs but the code has many long methods (>8 lines) and needs significant refactoring

### 2. Enumerable & Collections

* 1: Application demonstrates deficiencies with Enumerable and struggles with collections

### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 2: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient

### 4. Git Workflow

* FAIL: Developer does not commit often, commits are overly large, poor commit messages. Drastic changes in code in a single commit.

### 4. REPL Interface

* 1: Application's REPL has enough problems as to make play difficult

### 5. Breaking Logic into Components

* 2: Application shows some effort to break logic into components, but the divisions are inconsistent or unclear

### 6. Functional Expectations

* 1: Application does not run, crashes on start.
