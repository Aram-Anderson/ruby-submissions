Notes:  
Quit and play work, play includes player ship placement and works through first fire  
Talked through classes, demonstrates a good understanding of OOP w/ objects  
Frequent long methods, opportunities to refactor with nested loops and if/else  

Rubric:

### 1. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 2:  Application runs but the code has many long methods (>8 lines) and needs significant refactoring

### 2. Enumerable & Collections

* 2: Application demonstrates functional knowledge of Enumerable but only uses the most basic techniques

### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 2: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient

### 4. Git Workflow

* FAIL: Developer does not commit often, commits are overly large, poor commit messages. Drastic changes in code in a single commit.

### 4. REPL Interface

* 3: Application's REPL is clear and pleasant to use

### 5. Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart with clear intent and usage

### 6. Functional Expectations

* 2: Application runs, but does not work properly, or does not meet specifications.
