Notes:
* Applicaiton runs
* repl is nice
* Some duplicated and redundant code
* a lot is living in the battleship class

Rubric:

### 1. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 2:  Application runs but the code has many long methods (>8 lines) and needs significant refactoring


### 2. Enumerable & Collections

* 3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of several Enumerable techniques

### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests

### 4. Git Workflow

* FAIL: Developer does not commit often, commits are overly large, poor commit messages. Drastic changes in code in a single commit.

### 4. REPL Interface

* 3: Application's REPL is clear and pleasant to use

### 5. Breaking Logic into Components

* 2: Application shows some effort to break logic into components, but the divisions are inconsistent or unclear


### 6. Functional Expectations

* 3: Application meets all requirements as laid out per the specification.
