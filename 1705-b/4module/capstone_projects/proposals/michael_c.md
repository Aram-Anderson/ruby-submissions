### Project Template

### [Project Title]

### Pitch

A application that provides you a list of bars, restaurants that meet your specific parameters such as distance to travel, and money willing to spend. 

### Problem

You have a certain amount of money. And a certain distance you wish to travel. But where should you go out? This application solves that issue. Get a list back of every bar and restaurant. 

### Solution

The application will consume the google maps api which provides grographical data and the ability to produce directions. It also has restaurant data. 

### Target Audience

My app would be geared towards anyone who likes to go out. 

### New Techniques

I am hoping to do a one page application in React with no refreshing.

### Workflow

Waffle.io always.
