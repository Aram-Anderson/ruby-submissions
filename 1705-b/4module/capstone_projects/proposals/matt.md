### Correlation Station

### Pitch

Correlation Station (CS) will allow a user to see correlations among collected Fitbit data. For example, how does sleep affect heart rate, or activity level.

### Problem

Currently, Fitbit can collect a TON of data about your health. This includes, heart rate, weight, body fat, BMI, activity level, workouts, distance traveled, REM Sleep, Deep Sleep and other data points. What's interesting is that Fitbit does not correlate any of this data. This is a huge gap for potential functionality.

### Solution

CS will use the Fitbit API to pull data into a normalized, relational database. Data Analysis will be run to present the correlating data in easy-to-digest formats (charts, graphs, warning trends).

### Target Audience

Fitbit users and those who participate in the quantified self movement. CS will be for data and fitness nerds who want to see what's going on and answer the "why?" question.

### New Techniques

Python and Django for the back end using data analysis libraries. Javascript for front end presentation/UI.

### Workflow

Pivotal Tracker.
