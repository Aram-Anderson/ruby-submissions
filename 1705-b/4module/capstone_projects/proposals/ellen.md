### Project Template

### Crypto Books

### Pitch

1 sentence that explains the value proposition of the application. How would you explain it to a potential business partner, team member, or investor?

This application would allow users to see the order books of various cryptocurrency exchanges side by side, and will highlight arbitrage opportunities accross the exchanges. 

### Problem

1-3 sentences describing the problem that you are trying to solve.

Every cryptocurrency exchange has slightly different market prices at any given time. There will always be some ineffeciencies in the cryptocurrency markets known as arbitrage resulting from different exchanges having sell and buy orders that may have been filled by a sell or buy order on a different exchange. 

### Solution

1-3 sentences describing how your application will solve that problem.

This application will show the order books of different exchanges in realtime and highlight the arbitrage. The order books will be show in table format with a yellow highlight on rows where there is an arbitrage opportunity. I would also like to have a realltime graph showing the aggregate bids and asks and the arbitrage. Users will also be able to see this information for multiple different markets. 

### Target Audience

1-3 sentences describing what type of user your app would be applicable to.

The target audience would be people who have an observational interest in cryptocurrency markets. There are probably many more advanced tools out there for traders who are looking to profit off of the arbitrage inefficiencies, so this is more for casual observers and for people new to cryptocurrency markets.

### New Techniques

Which new techniques are you hoping to implement?

Websockets; asynchronous api calls in Node; creating realtime graphs with websockets; I may incorporate React if it makes sense

### Workflow

What project management tool will you be using to manage your progress?
