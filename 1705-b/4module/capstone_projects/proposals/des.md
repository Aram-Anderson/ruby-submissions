### Pitch

1 sentence that explains the value proposition of the application. How would you explain it to a potential business partner, team member, or investor?

Build an interactive application to model a phisiological or organ system with 3D templeting and interactive features -- close up functionality, and info for different parts. Value would be educational and/or for entertainment. 

### Problem

Teaching and studying anatomical systems can be tedeous and requires a lot of repetitive memorization and often flashcards. Interactive visual aides are a great method to increase study productivity and to encourage general curiosiry about a subject. Online tool are typically expensive and many are not hosted as web apps and require setup and downloading. 

### Solution

I'd like to create a web application that allows a user to easily interact with a physiological or organ system via interactive tooling and 3D modeling. 

### Target Audience

This can be applicable to anyone, target user is a student or anyone curious to learn about a body part/system. 

### New Techniques

This would be build utilizing a design/2D/3D tooling (utilized in game design) and potentially C#. I'd like to stay away from involving too many new technologies and am not sure what the stack will require. My preference is to use a JS frontend framework to manage most of the app's functionality. I am not sure what to anticipate in terms of deployment for this type of content.   

### Workflow

I can't decide if Pivotal is too heavy and unnecessary for a one-person project; I am leaning towards Waffle with Github integration.
