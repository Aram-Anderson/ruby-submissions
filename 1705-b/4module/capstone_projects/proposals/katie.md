### Project Template

### Title still under development...

### Pitch

* We're building an application that will display your water tank level data in real-time using a custom-engineered sensor.

### Problem

* Many industries produce wastewater or require fresh water for their operations, and keep water in tanks onsite.
* Currently, there isn't a great solution for automatic monitoring of water levels.

### Solution

* Our sensor transmits the level data automatically over a cell modem to an external site for you to view.
* Ultimately, the goal is to provide analytics on your tanks' levels over time.
* A larger goal is to develop a platform to help automate the draining and refilling of tanks. 

### Target Audience

* Any industrial business or entity (i.e. water utility company) that relies on water tanks.

### New Techniques

Which new techniques are you hoping to implement?

* Using EventMachine and MQTT bindings to connect to Eclipse and receive data
* Implementing background workers to collect and cache data
* Potentially using Docker to containerize app
* Potentially using React to display the front-end

### Workflow

What project management tool will you be using to manage your progress?

* Waffle
