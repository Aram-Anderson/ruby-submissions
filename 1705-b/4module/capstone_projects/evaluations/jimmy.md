Self Assessment Rubric

_Please choose the score you think you've earned in each category below. Please also describe why you feel you've earned this score for each section!_

### 1. Project Planning & Management


*   3: Developer uses an iteration map to plan project scope, breaks down broad features into granular tasks, and exercises good Git workflow (e.g., feature branches, descriptive commits, incremental PRs)

    I used pivotal tracker to break down all my main tasks and extensions. I used proper git workflow to commit with detailed messages.

### 2. Completion & Pace

*   3: Developer plans stories ahead of sprint and makes some scope adjustments along the way

    I completed the main functionality that I set out to accomplish and that was for a user to be able to create donations.
     I had extensions and styling that needed to be done in future iterations.

### 3. Implementation Quality


*   3: Project exhibits tested (where applicable), maintainable, and well-organized code. Developer can speak to architecture and implementation decisions

     I had requests test for my backend but no tests on front end react native. My code organization is great. I separated code into their own files and folder and the syling is in one file done in alphabetical order.

### 4. Application of Techniques

*   4: Developer builds project in a new language(s) or framework(s)

     I used React Native to build my Front end app and used new libraries on top to implement some of the features

### 5. Documentation

*   3: Developer provides easy to navigate documentation showing how to setup and contribute to the application

          I developed a README setup and instructions to get started on both apps.

### 6. Accessibility

*   2: Developer considers accessibility issues but has not yet produced code to address them

     I had thought about implementing more accesibility into my app but time was the biggest challenge that prevented me to do so.

### Notes:

- Rails auth, data store, submit requests
- PR with comments from classmates or instructor
- Would have liked to see more documentation, it is pretty brief
