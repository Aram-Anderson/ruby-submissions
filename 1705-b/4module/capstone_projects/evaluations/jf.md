_Please choose the score you think you've earned in each category below. Please also describe why you feel you've earned this score for each section!_

### 1. Project Planning & Management

*   3: Developer uses an iteration map to plan project scope, breaks down broad features into granular tasks, and exercises good Git workflow (e.g., feature branches, descriptive commits, incremental PRs)

     * With the project I tackled, it was difficult to get to a granular level of description until I was in the process of solving a problem. I broke out the major steps needed to accomplish my goal, but since this was all so new I documented the process in the form of a blog instead. This way my steps and the decisions that I made can be explained with greater context.
     
### 2. Completion & Pace

*   3: Developer plans stories ahead of sprint and makes some scope adjustments along the way

     * I had an action plan on waffle early on, and I communicated blockers as they came up. Unfortunately I was unable to overcome one blocker, so I made an adjustment to a different technology, as I had laid out in my communication.

### 3. Implementation Quality

*   3: Project exhibits tested (where applicable), maintainable, and well-organized code. Developer can speak to architecture and implementation decisions
     
     * Since this was all so new to me, I read the offical documentation for all technologies that I used. I followed several different tutorials, all of which had parts that were missing or broken. I tested different methodologies and documented the ones that worked in order for future users to be able to successfully implement these technologies.

### 4. Application of Techniques

*   4: Developer builds project in a new language(s) or framework(s)

     * Everything I used was completely new and foreign to me. While I was not able to have success with Kubernetes, I did use Docker Swarm successfully on a dockerized Rails app running on a cluster of Raspberry Pis, while demonstrating the Swarm's load-balancing properties and scaling abilities.

### 5. Documentation

*   4: Developer also adds a screencast, tutorial or other wow factor

     * I amassed a great deal of information from many different sources: Official docs, github issues, tutorials, stackoverflow, etc. I then distilled all the pertinent information into a tutorial in the hopes of other users learning from my mistakes and following a path that works.

### 6. Accessibility

*   3: Developer implements code to increase accessibility
     
     * One of the ideas behind this project was that utilizing these technologies allows people with fewer resources (staff, money, etc.) to benefit from hosting their own apps in a scalable environment. In this way, we are making web development accessible to a wider range of people.
