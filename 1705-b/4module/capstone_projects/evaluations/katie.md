_Please choose the score you think you've earned in each category below. Please also describe why you feel you've earned this score for each section!_

### 1. Project Planning & Management

*   3: Developer uses an iteration map to plan project scope, breaks down broad features into granular tasks, and exercises good Git workflow (e.g., feature branches, descriptive commits, incremental PRs)

My Git workflow could have been better, and I didn't use a tracker tool for this (which is weird for me). However, I think my communication with my technical lead made up for some of these deficiencies; the project status was always known to both parties.

### 2. Completion & Pace

*   4: Developer delivers stories committed to before starting the sprint

I achieved the original agreed-upon scope, and attempted to go beyond.

### 3. Implementation Quality

*   3: Project exhibits tested (where applicable), maintainable, and well-organized code. Developer can speak to architecture and implementation decisions

While testing for my MQTT library is somewhat lacking, overall the backend was lightweight enough that testing is sufficient. ActionCable and React testing were agreed to be outside the scope of the project.

### 4. Application of Techniques

*   4: Developer builds project in a new language(s) or framework(s)

I used React to build my front end. I also worked with a new Ruby library (MQTT) and ActionCable was new to me as well (not taught in the curriculum).

### 5. Documentation

*   3: Developer provides easy to navigate documentation showing how to setup and contribute to the application

Both the frontend and backend READMEs have information about the project, how to set up and contribution ideas, as well as information on the general topics involved and the architecture decisions.

### 6. Accessibility

*   2: Developer considers accessibility issues but has not yet produced code to address them

When using a screen reader (VoiceOver), my actual tank data from Highcharts cannot be read aloud. My navbar dropdown does work without the use of a mouse.
