Self Assessment Rubric

_Please choose the score you think you've earned in each category below. Please also describe why you feel you've earned this score for each section!_

### 1. Project Planning & Management

*   3: Developer uses an iteration map to plan project scope, breaks down broad features into granular tasks, and exercises good Git workflow (e.g., feature branches, descriptive commits, incremental PRs)
*   2: Developer has a mental vision for the project iterations, shows some use of a tracker tool, and uses Git effectively

It was difficult to plan in a concrete way because of my limited knowledge of the problem scope and tools available. As I started to understand those better, I still have to make many adjustments but I was able to stick to the larger plan. I wish I had done a better job implementing Waffle.

### 2. Completion & Pace

*   3: Developer plans stories ahead of sprint and makes some scope adjustments along the way
For this project, planning was done based on architectural functionality rather than user stories. I had to adjust to changes constantly besed on what I discovered along the way as I was implementing JS and a library for graphics.

### 3. Implementation Quality

*   3: Project exhibits tested (where applicable), maintainable, and well-organized code. Developer can speak to architecture and implementation decisions

I would like to reorganzie some of the code, but I used different methods and strategies for the different models on purpose and in order to understand three.js better. I've been able to start comparing solutions and understanding for choosing only certain libraries and design practices in the future.

### 4. Application of Techniques

*   4: Developer builds project in a new language(s) or framework(s)
This is a front end project in JS with WebJL and Three.js. I had to review many tools -- libraries, docs, and software -- that I had never used before.

### 5. Documentation

*   4: Developer also adds a screencast, tutorial or other wow factor
I included a homepage with screenshots of the models and due to how difficult the core of the problem was to navigate, I'd like to implement a tutorial style file to document what I discovered and continue to find out along the way.
*   3: Developer provides easy to navigate documentation showing how to setup and contribute to the application
*   2: Developer provides barebones documentation showing how to get the dev environment up and running

### 6. Accessibility

*   3: Developer implements code to increase accessibility
Functionality is accessible with uponkeydow
There is little HTML in this project
I am researching strategies to make this type of interactive environment more accessible
*   2: Developer considers accessibility issues but has not yet produced code to address them
