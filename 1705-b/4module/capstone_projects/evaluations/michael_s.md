Self Assessment Rubric

_Please choose the score you think you've earned in each category below. Please also describe why you feel you've earned this score for each section!_

### 1. Project Planning & Management

*   2: Developer has a mental vision for the project iterations, shows some use of a tracker tool, and uses Git effectively
     My Pivotal tracker was not utilized well, stories could have been broken into more granular tasks.

### 2. Completion & Pace

*   2: Developer implements very little of the planned sprint
     Only about half of the stories planned for this sprint were actually completed.

### 3. Implementation Quality

*   2: Project demonstrates some gaps in code quality and/or developers cannot defend their decisions
     Code quality is bad, very little organization on the backend, messy use of state on the React side.

### 4. Application of Techniques

*   4: Developer builds project in a new language(s) or framework(s)
     This project was built in express and React, I used mostly raw sql for queries.

### 5. Documentation

*   2: Developer provides barebones documentation showing how to get the dev environment up and running
     Documentation could cover a lot more.

### 6. Accessibility

*   2: Developer considers accessibility issues but has not yet produced code to address them
     I had accessibility in mind, but I just was not able to implement it well.
