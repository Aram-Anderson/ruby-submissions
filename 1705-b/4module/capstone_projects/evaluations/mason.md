Self Assessment Rubric
------------

### 1. Project Planning & Management

*   3: Developer uses an iteration map to plan project scope, breaks down broad features into granular tasks, and exercises good Git workflow (e.g., feature branches, descriptive commits, incremental PRs)

- Used Evernote extensively to plan out progress and requirements. Git Workflow was nonexistent, but I was using a different technology that didnt lend aswell to GitHub.

### 2. Completion & Pace

*   3: Developer plans stories ahead of sprint and makes some scope adjustments along the way

- Happy with the progess made, will continue to make more but always wish I had more time to work on it

### 3. Implementation Quality

*   3: Project exhibits tested (where applicable), maintainable, and well-organized code. Developer can speak to architecture and implementation decisions

- Solid organization and use of clean code.

### 4. Application of Techniques

*   4: Developer builds project in a new language(s) or framework(s)

- Had never touched Unity or C# or Animation before this.

### 5. Documentation

*   3: Developer provides easy to navigate documentation showing how to setup and contribute to the application

- Dev environment is a little tricky as of right now. Still need to export the project.

### 6. Accessibility

*   1: Developer does not consider accessibility issues

- I feel that this is not applicable to my project given the nature of it.
