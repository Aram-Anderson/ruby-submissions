_Please choose the score you think you've earned in each category below. Please also describe why you feel you've earned this score for each section!_

### 1. Project Planning & Management
I think that I deserve a 3 because I used an iteration map for the overall project, broke down features into smaller tasks, and adhered to a professional Git workflow.

*   4: Developer has a highly detailed iteration map, sophisticated organization in their tracker tool, and exceptional Git workflow
*   **3: Developer uses an iteration map to plan project scope, breaks down broad features into granular tasks, and exercises good Git workflow (e.g., feature branches, descriptive commits, incremental PRs)**
*   2: Developer has a mental vision for the project iterations, shows some use of a tracker tool, and uses Git effectively
*   1: Developer shows little evidence of project planning and management

### 2. Completion & Pace
I completed everything I planned on completing, so I think that a 4 is appropriate.
*   **4: Developer delivers stories committed to before starting the sprint**
*   3: Developer plans stories ahead of sprint and makes some scope adjustments along the way
*   2: Developer implements very little of the planned sprint
*   1: Developer does not plan or complete sprint

### 3. Implementation Quality
I set up a test environment with Node and MongoDB, and I did a lot of unit testing of my methods and my interaction with the database. My code is reasonably well-organized and maintainable, which was challenging because of the race conditions involved in real-time data and database interaction. I think that a 3 is reasonable.

*   4: Project demonstrates exceptionally well tested (where applicable) and maintainable code
      * for topics outside of BE curriculum, developer can speak to best practices applied
*   **3: Project exhibits tested (where applicable), maintainable, and well-organized code. Developer can speak to architecture and implementation decisions**
*   2: Project demonstrates some gaps in code quality and/or developers cannot defend their decisions
*   1: Project demonstrates poor factoring and/or understanding of general programming principles such as MVC and OOP

### 4. Application of Techniques
All of the technologies in this application are new to me, so I think I deserve a 4 here.

*   **4: Developer builds project in a new language(s) or framework(s)**
*   3: Developer implements four new techniques or patterns
*   2: Developer implements 3 or less major techniques that have not been previously attempted
*   1: Developer does not implement new techniques

### 5. Documentation
I added a README with basic documentation on how to use the application. I could probably improve the documentation by providing more information about how the code works and how to contribute. I think that a 2 or 3 is reasonable here.

*   4: Developer also adds a screencast, tutorial or other wow factor
*   3: Developer provides easy to navigate documentation showing how to setup and contribute to the application
*   **2: Developer provides barebones documentation showing how to get the dev environment up and running**
*   1: Developer provides insufficient documentation

### 6. Accessibility
Since this application is a WebSocket server with no front-end, I do not think that this section is relevant.

*   4: Developer expertly implements features to follow accessibility best practices
*   3: Developer implements code to increase accessibility
*   2: Developer considers accessibility issues but has not yet produced code to address them
*   1: Developer does not consider accessibility issues
