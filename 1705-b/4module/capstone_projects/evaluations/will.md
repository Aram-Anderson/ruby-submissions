_Please choose the score you think you've earned in each category below. Please also describe why you feel you've earned this score for each section!_

### NOTE
 - Run in local environment. I was going through the Heroku asset pipeline errors for my frontend resolving an HTTP vs HTTPS error for my `dimplejs` graphs. Additionally, I had to reformat all my `let` into `var` and finally ES6 was not supported so I would have needed to go through and replace every ES6 string sign with `"`. I used ES6 string intopolation for every situation I needed to concatinate strings, so replacing those would have been going through the entire repo and replacing every instance and reformatting my string. That is a later issue to deal with I think.

- Until then, setup your local DB and run `rails s` to get the frontend interaction with graphical display of data.

### 1. Project Planning & Management

*   1: Developer shows little evidence of project planning and management

Reasoning: Honestly, wasn't really into this project at all and just kind of wanted to be able to let my code kind of take me wherever. I just wanted some experience with data visualization but writing out cards and maintaining them for myself on a 1 week project that didn't really interest me to begin with for the sake of 'showcasing' my ability to organize time and document my work wasn't worth it to me.

### 2. Completion & Pace

*   1: Developer does not plan or complete sprint

Reasoning: Same

### 3. Implementation Quality

*   2: Project exhibits tested (where applicable), maintainable, and well-organized code. Developer can speak to architecture and implementation decisions

Reasoning: I can do all that stuff just not sure it's all that good...

### 4. Application of Techniques

*   3: Developer implements four new techniques or patterns

Reasoning: Large scale data parsing/seeding/rendering, hitting internal apis from my own app, JQuery/AJAX, d3/dimplejs graphing.

### 5. Documentation

*   3: Developer provides easy to navigate documentation showing how to setup and contribute to the application

Reasoning: Seems like a decent README.md

### 6. Accessibility

*   3: Developer implements code to increase accessibility

Reasoning: Not an expert by any means but I looked up color patterns to avoid for color blind people as well as the benefits of a simplistic design both for color blindness and dyslexia. Additional I use buttons as much as possible for my clickable items rather than links if possible for better mouseless use of my keyboard.
