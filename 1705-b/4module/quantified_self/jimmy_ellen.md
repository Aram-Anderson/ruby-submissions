## Self Assessment Rubric

Please self assess with the rubric below. Provide additional information to explain why you feel your project displays the score you've given yourself in _each_ section.

### Specification Adherence

Application implements **all** functionality as defined, but some bugs or strange behavior where features intersect.

- Meets Expectations

All functionality is implemented except the 3 user stories that Casey allowed us to drop.


### Documentation

Developer provides easy to navigate documentation showing how to setup and contribute to the application.

- Meets Expectations

We provided details on both the front and backend repos.


### HTML/UI

The team put some effort into styling, and the application is not confusing to use. HTML classes and IDs are kebab case.


- Meets Expectations

 Our css classes are kebab case. We used bootstrap and font-awesome to keep the styling clean and orderly. 

### Accessibility

Developer implements code to increase accessibility.


- Meets Expectations

Our color scheme is mostly black and white, allowing for color blind people to use the site. Our tables and buttons can be accessed via tabbing.

### JS syntax and Style

JavaScript code is logically divided into files. Developers can show examples of good coding practices and demonstrate OOP concepts, like DRY and separation of concerns. Developers pay attention to indentation and naming conventions. They also consistently utilize ES5 or ES6 syntax and jQuery when working with events.


- Meets Expectations

We tried to be consistent with ES6 but there may be some exceptions. The backend is well organized with models, controllers, and a routing file. Due to extenuating circumstances we did not have time to refatcor the front end and organize it in the way we would like.


### Git Workflow

The team uses master for production, uses feature branches for small groups of cards, and has a pull request for each feature with good context and conversation. Developers that aren't on the team have commented on PRs.

- Meets Expectations

We tagged our Product Owner in most of our big PRs and had good conversations. We used branches, submitted PRs, used our pivotal tracker efficiently. 

### Project Management

The team is using a project management tool to keep their project organized and to track progress. Team is documenting conclusions and timelines on relevant cards.

- Meets Expectations

We were diligent in keeping up with our pivotal tracker and updating cards. We did not make comments on cards.


### Communication

The team consistently reaches out to their Technical Lead for feedback on code quality and technical issues. The team responds to their Technical Lead in a timely manner.

- Meets Expectations

We reached out to Casey via github all through the process.
