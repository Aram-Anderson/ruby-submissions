Developers pay attention to indentation and naming conventions. They also consistently utilize ES5 or ES6 syntax and jQuery when working with events.

- Above Expectations
- **Meets Expectations**
- Below Expectations

Note: We did our best to follow OO concepts and good coding style in the timeframe we had.
