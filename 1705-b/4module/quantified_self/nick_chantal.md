[Frontend Production](https://d2irwba0vlxvu5.cloudfront.net)
This is our Frontend application which is communicating with our Node/Express backend. There are bugs in the Diary page which we have not yet been able to fix (for example, the page needs to be refreshed to display a new meal-food relationship, and none of the meal-food relationships will be displayed when all of the foods are deleted from a meal). However, when connected to the Rails backend, our Frontend application meets all expectations and is in production [here](https://d10383zd199nnr.cloudfront.net)

## Self Assessment Rubric

Please self assess with the rubric below. Provide additional information to explain why you feel your project displays the score you've given yourself in _each_ section.

### Specification Adherence

Application implements **all** functionality as defined, but some bugs or strange behavior where features intersect.

- Above Expectations
- **Meets Expectations**
- Below Expectations

Note: No bugs

### Documentation

Developer provides easy to navigate documentation showing how to setup and contribute to the application.

- Above Expectations
- **Meets Expectations**
- Below Expectations

Note: Readme files added, so users can clone down an use our apps.

### HTML/UI

The team put some effort into styling, and the application is not confusing to use. HTML classes and IDs are kebab case.

- **Above Expectations**
- Meets Expectations
- Below Expectations

Note: We think it look pretty amazing.

### Accessibility

Developer implements code to increase accessibility.

- Above Expectations
- **Meets Expectations**
- Below Expectations

Note: We added keyboard accessibility, so people with disability can navigate our app.

### JS syntax and Style

JavaScript code is logically divided into files. Developers can show examples of good coding practices and demonstrate OOP concepts, like DRY and separation of concerns. Developers pay attention to indentation and naming conventions. They also consistently utilize ES5 or ES6 syntax and jQuery when working with events.

- Above Expectations
- **Meets Expectations**
- Below Expectations

Note: We did our best to follow OO concepts and good coding style in the timeframe we had.

### Git Workflow

The team uses master for production, uses feature branches for small groups of cards, and has a pull request for each feature with good context and conversation. Developers that aren't on the team have commented on PRs.

- Above Expectations
- **Meets Expectations**
- Below Expectations

Note: We had conversions and comments in both sides of our app on github.

### Project Management

The team is using a project management tool to keep their project organized and to track progress. Team is documenting conclusions and timelines on relevant cards.

- Above Expectations
- **Meets Expectations**
- Below Expectations

Note: We used pivotal tracker to keep track of our user stories.

### Communication

The team consistently reaches out to their Technical Lead for feedback on code quality and technical issues. The team responds to their Technical Lead in a timely manner.

- Above Expectations
- Meets Expectations
- **Below Expectations**

Note: We didn't get to stuck implementing a user story so we didn't reached out, however thinking back we could've reached out for some
feedback for code quality.

## Instructor Rubric

### Evaluated By: Lauren

### Notes:

- Because all functionality is not implemented on Node API, spec adherence is at a below expectations
- Lots of functions need further refactoring. For example, `filterFoods` and `sortByCalories` or `quickSort`. File/class separation is solid, though
- Great use of `addClass` and `removeClass`
