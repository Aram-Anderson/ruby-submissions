## Self Assessment Rubric

Please self assess with the rubric below. Provide additional information to explain why you feel your project displays the score you've given yourself in _each_ section.

### Specification Adherence

Application implements **all** functionality as defined, but some bugs or strange behavior where features intersect.

- Above Expectations
- Meets Expectations
- Below Expectations


-Self: We feel this largely meets expectations. All features are implemented, still some bugs(documented in issues on front end repo).

### Documentation

Developer provides easy to navigate documentation showing how to setup and contribute to the application.

- Above Expectations
- Meets Expectations
- Below Expectations


-Self: Meets expectations - ReadMe documentation written for both FE and BE

### HTML/UI

The team put some effort into styling, and the application is not confusing to use. HTML classes and IDs are kebab case.

- Above Expectations
- Meets Expectations
- Below Expectations


-Self: Meets Expectations - The page isn't "actively hostile". Buttons and tables are styled. IDs are kabob case.

### Accessibility

Developer implements code to increase accessibility.

- Above Expectations
- Meets Expectations
- Below Expectations


-Self: Below Expectations - Did not actively try to incorporate accessibility.

### JS syntax and Style

JavaScript code is logically divided into files. Developers can show examples of good coding practices and demonstrate OOP concepts, like DRY and separation of concerns. Developers pay attention to indentation and naming conventions. They also consistently utilize ES5 or ES6 syntax and jQuery when working with events.

- Above Expectations
- Meets Expectations
- Below Expectations


-Self: Front End: Meets Expectations - Shared code sits in a shared file. Code is broken into only a few separate files. Classes and DRY code used. ES6 syntax consistently used.

-Self: Back End: Below Expectations - All code sitting in server.js, attempt made at refactoring into MVC model

### Git Workflow

The team uses master for production, uses feature branches for small groups of cards, and has a pull request for each feature with good context and conversation. Developers that aren't on the team have commented on PRs.

- Above Expectations
- Meets Expectations
- Below Expectations


-Self: Meets Expectations - We did fall behind on tagging Casey. However we consistently used Master for production deployment, Development as active working branch with feature branches from Development.

- Above Expectations
- Meets Expectations
- Below Expectations


-Self: Meets Expectations - Used Pivotal Tracker Consistently during Front End phase.
