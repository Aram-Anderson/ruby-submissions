Hi Casey,

As you know, we were involved in a separate project as a follow-up to the Hackathon. We attempted to get as much done as possible. Michael and I lost literally five full days on this project due to splitting time.

Sorry we weren't in more communication. Our hair has been on fire for the last three weeks and we've been in full burn mode.

Thanks for all your help on this.

Michael and Matt

## Self Assessment Rubric

Please self assess with the rubric below. Provide additional information to explain why you feel your project displays the score you've given yourself in _each_ section.

### Specification Adherence

Application implements **all** functionality as defined, but some bugs or strange behavior where features intersect.

- Above Expectations
- Meets Expectations
- Below Expectations

-Self: We feel this largely meets expectations. All features are implemented except sorting by calories.

### Documentation

Developer provides easy to navigate documentation showing how to setup and contribute to the application.

- Above Expectations
- Meets Expectations
- Below Expectations

-Self: Below expectations - ReadMe documentation written for Front End but not Back End

### HTML/UI

The team put some effort into styling, and the application is not confusing to use. HTML classes and IDs are kebab case.

- Above Expectations
- Meets Expectations
- Below Expectations

-Self: Meets Expectations - The page isn't "actively hostile". Buttons are styled. IDs are kabob case.

### Accessibility

Developer implements code to increase accessibility.

- Above Expectations
- Meets Expectations
- Below Expectations

-Self: Below Expectations - Did not actively try to incorporate accessibility.

### JS syntax and Style

JavaScript code is logically divided into files. Developers can show examples of good coding practices and demonstrate OOP concepts, like DRY and separation of concerns. Developers pay attention to indentation and naming conventions. They also consistently utilize ES5 or ES6 syntax and jQuery when working with events.

- Above Expectations
- Meets Expectations
- Below Expectations

-Self: Meets Expectations - We did fall behind on tagging Casey. However we consistently used Master for production deployment, Development as active working branch with feature branches from Development.
