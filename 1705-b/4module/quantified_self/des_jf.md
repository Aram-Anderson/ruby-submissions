## Self Assessment Rubric

Please self assess with the rubric below. Provide additional information to explain why you feel your project displays the score you've given yourself in _each_ section.

### Specification Adherence

Application implements **all** functionality as defined, but some bugs or strange behavior where features intersect.

- Meets Expectations: We run into issues we didn't anticipate with trying to connect the backend and the pront end and deplying in production; it would take us a littl emore time to understand what is causing the issues and bugs that were not there yesterday.


### Documentation

Developer provides easy to navigate documentation showing how to setup and contribute to the application.

- Above Expectations: We created a readme file to document our app functionality.


### HTML/UI

The team put some effort into styling, and the application is not confusing to use. HTML classes and IDs are kebab case.


- Meets Expectations: We tried to follow HTML/CSS conventions the best we knew how; we came up with cohesive styling.


### Accessibility

Developer implements code to increase accessibility.



- Meets Expectations: User can use tab to select buttons and check boxes

### JS syntax and Style

JavaScript code is logically divided into files. Developers can show examples of good coding practices and demonstrate OOP concepts, like DRY and separation of concerns. Developers pay attention to indentation and naming conventions. They also consistently utilize ES5 or ES6 syntax and jQuery when working with events.

- Meets Expectations


### Git Workflow

The team uses master for production, uses feature branches for small groups of cards, and has a pull request for each feature with good context and conversation. Developers that aren't on the team have commented on PRs.

- Above Expectations


### Project Management

The team is using a project management tool to keep their project organized and to track progress. Team is documenting conclusions and timelines on relevant cards.

- Above Expectations


### Communication

The team consistently reaches out to their Technical Lead for feedback on code quality and technical issues. The team responds to their Technical Lead in a timely manner.

- Meets Expectations

## Instructor Rubric

### Evaluated By: Katelyn

### Notes:

- No updated README just the one with the starter kit. nothing for the backend

- Requests take a long time and don't update the page (i.e adding and removing food to meals) receiving a 503 from the server for those calls

- Would liked to have seen more collaboration on github PRs most just say looks good without any constructive comments

- Can't switch back to diaries page

- Weird behavior when trying to sort by calories

- `tabindex` :+1:

- mix of ajax requests & DOM manipulation in very long single functions

- `FoodCall` has 3 different const for similar url

- getting response in `postFood` and `updateFood` and doing nothing with it

- in `FoodHandler` using 2 different ways to write functions within 1 function for example `createHandler`

- Would have liked to see api endpoint documentation
