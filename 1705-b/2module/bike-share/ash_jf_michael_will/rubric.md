## Notes:
* Some sweet animations
* Clean design
* clean controller
* trips dashboard - so much database
* Every view should have a corresponding test
* feature tests test only base base functionality, some holes

## Rubric:

### 1. Functional Expectations

* 2: Application has some small missing base functionality

### 2. ActiveRecord

* 3: ActiveRecord methods generally live in the appropriate model, but some Ruby is used to organize data after database queries. A project at this level may have some queries that have not produced the correct results based on the expectations described, but in those cases the query was still generally on the right path and demonstrated some minor misunderstanding.

### 3. User Experience and Conventions

* 3: Project still uses appropriate routes and HTTP verbs. All pieces of the application can be accessed without entering addresses manually in the navbar. User experience is pleasant, but may need additional improvement before truly being ready to be deployed to production for a client.

### 4. Code Organization/Quality

* 2: Code does not represent a significant effort to refactor. Logic leaks into the views or controllers. Long methods may exist, and the purpose behind some methods may be unclear.

### 5. Testing

* 2: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient

### 6. Working Collaboratively

* 3: Good use of branches, pull requests, and a project-management tool.
