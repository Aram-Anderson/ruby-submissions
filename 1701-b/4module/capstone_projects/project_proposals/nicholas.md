### Project Template

### [Tinkr](https://github.com/NicholasJacques/Tinkr)

### Pitch

A mobile app that helps users track the maintenance schedule for their vehicle.

### Problem

It's hard to remember when you should do maintenance on your vehicles. This results in poor performance and voided warrantees.

### Solution

This is a mobile application that will allow users to select the vehicles that they own and receive recurring reminders when their vehicle is due for manufacturer reccomended maintenance.

### Target Audience

This app could be usefull for both commercial and non-commercial users. This app would be especially usefull for small business owners who have to manage fleets of vehicles

### New Techniques

I plan to build the mobile app in React Native. There will be a rails backend to store user data. Car maintenance information will come from the Edmunds API.

### Workflow

I plan to use pivotal tracker to manage the project. I am waiting to recieve my API key from Edmunds. Until then I am going to start building user stories for the front-end mobile application.
