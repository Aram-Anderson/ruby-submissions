_Please choose the score you think you've earned in each category below. Please also describe why you feel you've earned this score for each section!_

### 2. Completion & Pace
*   3: Developer plans stories ahead of sprint and makes some scope adjustments along the way

I planned my stories out early on and made necessery adjustments along the way. Had to pivot once or twice.

Aplication is built entirely with React.

While not directly writing code for acessibility, I used best pratices for designing the app using ARIA guidlines.
