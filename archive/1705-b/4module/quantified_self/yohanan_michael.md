## Self Assessment Rubric

Please self assess with the rubric below. Provide additional information to explain why you feel your project displays the score you've given yourself in _each_ section.

### Specification Adherence

Application implements **all** functionality as defined, but some bugs or strange behavior where features intersect.


- Below Expectations

### Documentation

Developer provides easy to navigate documentation showing how to setup and contribute to the application.


- Meets Expectations


### HTML/UI

The team put some effort into styling, and the application is not confusing to use. HTML classes and IDs are kebab case.


- Meets Expectations

It looks nice and makes sense.

### Accessibility

Developer implements code to increase accessibility.


- Below Expectations

### JS syntax and Style

JavaScript code is logically divided into files. Developers can show examples of good coding practices and demonstrate OOP concepts, like DRY and separation of concerns. Developers pay attention to indentation and naming conventions. They also consistently utilize ES5 or ES6 syntax and jQuery when working with events.

- Meets Expectations


### Git Workflow

The team uses master for production, uses feature branches for small groups of cards, and has a pull request for each feature with good context and conversation. Developers that aren't on the team have commented on PRs.


- Meets Expectations


### Project Management

The team is using a project management tool to keep their project organized and to track progress. Team is documenting conclusions and timelines on relevant cards.


- Below Expectations

Didn't use a manager just myself.

### Communication

The team consistently reaches out to their Technical Lead for feedback on code quality and technical issues. The team responds to their Technical Lead in a timely manner.


- Meets Expectations

## Instructor Rubric

### Evaluated By: Lauren

### Notes:

- All commits on master - need better git workflow than that
- Documentation is still starter kit's documentation
- As far as code goes, for what is there, there could be a lot more effort put into organization and DRYness. Your functions are largely too long, separation of concerns isn't very present, and there's way too much of a mix between DOM manipulation with jQuery and raw JS.
