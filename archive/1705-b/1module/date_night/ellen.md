Notes:
* Next time use lib and test directories
* separate classes and tests into their own files
* Very unique approach to search and using it to support max and min
* be careful of what you use instance variables for
Rubric:

### 1. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

### 4. Functional Expectations

* 2: Application runs, but does not work properly, or does not meet specifications.
