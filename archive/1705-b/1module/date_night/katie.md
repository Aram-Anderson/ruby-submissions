Notes:
* 10 tests, all passing 
* make sure that tests are actually looking for the information you care about
* need tests for node
* functionality works until sort, depth of does not work

Rubric:

### 1. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 2: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient


### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

### 4. Functional Expectations

* 2: Application runs, but does not work properly, or does not meet specifications.
