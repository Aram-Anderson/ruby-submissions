Notes:
Said "Really well"  
Done through iteration  4  
Simplecov at 99.4
34.7523s to run their test suite  
382 assertions 194 tests  
any, reduce, map, find, find_all
Test Challenges: Fixtures difficult to align with needs  
Test Success: Broad scope, helped with ability to trace data  
Ruby & Style:
Items as a hash - position wasn't going to matter, hash to array easier than array to hash, saves iteration on some of the find methods  
Method lengths are great, talked through how to refactor some longer methods - long methods aren't even that long  
Components:  
Good use classes   
Spoke to spec being fairly intuitive until Iter 4 - then got confusing what was actually being asked for  





### 1. Fundamental Ruby & Style

*   4:  Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and refactoring

### 2. Breaking Logic into Components

*   3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

### 3. Test-Driven Development

*   4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data

### 4. Functional Expectations

*   3: Application implements iterations 0, 1, 2, 3, and either 4 or 5

### 5. Code Sanitation

The output from `rake sanitation:all` shows...

*   4: Zero complaints
