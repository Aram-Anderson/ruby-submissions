Notes: 
* Application works. Translates to and fro.
* Very light on testing, some tests do not run, a lot of tests were skipped.
* think about the pattern of methods sending and receiving messages with a method that coordinates
all of the actions rather than having a bunch of methods just modify instance variables.
* avoid using single letter variables - be as expressive and communicative with your code as possible.
* Watch indentation and whitespace - look into using a linter such as rubocop.

Rubric: 


### 1. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 2:  Application runs but the code has long methods, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and needs significant refactoring


### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 1: Application does not demonstrate use of TDD, or an insufficient number of tests.

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 2: Application makes use of some classes, but the divisions or encapsulation are unclear.


### 4. Functional Expectations

* 3: Application meets all requirements as laid out per the specification.
