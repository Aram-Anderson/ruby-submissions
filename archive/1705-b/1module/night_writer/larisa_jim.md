Rubric:
Pieces of the functionality exist, but are not tied together  
Methods are trim  
Some extra variable assignment - redundant
9 tests, 5 passing

### 1. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 2:  Application runs but the code has long methods, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and needs significant refactoring

### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 2: Application makes use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application consistently breaks concepts into classes and methods which have appropriate scope and responsibilities (SRP).

### 4. Functional Expectations

* 1: Application does not run, crashes on start.
