Notes: 
* Application translates english to braille.
* Would like to have seen more testing - Every class should have its own test, every method should have at least
one corresponding test at minimum.
* IN the future, depend less on instance variables to do your information sharing for you - methods should be sending and 
recieving messages.


Rubric:

### 1. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 1: Application does not demonstrate use of TDD, or an insufficient number of tests.

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 2: Application makes use of some classes, but the divisions or encapsulation are unclear.


### 4. Functional Expectations

* 2: Application runs, but does not work properly, or does not meet specifications.
