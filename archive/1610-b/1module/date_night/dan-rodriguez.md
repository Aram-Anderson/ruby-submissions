Repo:

Notes:

* 15 tests all pass
* Tests are strong with some gaps for better progression / edge cases / simple cases
* Implementation is good, doesn't quite feel like native Ruby
* Overall a strong project

Score:

### 1. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

### 2. Functional Expectations

* 3: Application fulfills all base expectations

### 3. Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application consistently breaks concepts into classes which encapsulate functionality. (SRP).

### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines)  needs some refactoring, and is mostly idiomatic.
