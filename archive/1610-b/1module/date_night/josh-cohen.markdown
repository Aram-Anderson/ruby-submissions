Notes:
* Testing sufficient, some opportunities to add more isolation tests for supporting methods
* Meets all base expectations
* Solid SRP, opportunity to break health calculations into another class
* Some long methods, overall solid effort at refactoring. 

Score:

### 1. Test-Driven Development
* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality
 
### 2. Functional Expectations
* 3: Application fulfills all base expectations

### 3. Breaking Logic into Components
* 3: Application consistently breaks concepts into classes which encapsulate functionality. (SRP).

### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style
* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines)  needs some refactoring, and is mostly idiomatic.
