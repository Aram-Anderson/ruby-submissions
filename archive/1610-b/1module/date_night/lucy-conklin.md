Notes:
* Missing some basic functionality
* Opportunities to refactor, extract functionality from long methods
* Overall sound implementation, just needed to get further and refactor

Score:

### 1. Test-Driven Development
* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality
 
### 2. Functional Expectations
* 2: Application is missing one base expectation

### 3. Breaking Logic into Components
* 2: Application makes use of some classes, but the divisions or encapsulation are unclear.

### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style
* 2:  Application runs but the code has many long methods (>8 lines), has poorly named variables, needs significant refactoring, and is somewhat idiomatic.
