Repo:

Notes:

* Started a bit late because I was waiting for the TDD class
* 18 test all pass
* Pretty good test progression
* Fill out the naming of tests, variables, etc
* Implementation has room for refactoring but is effective

Score:

### 1. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

### 2. Functional Expectations

* 2: Application is missing one base expectation

### 3. Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application consistently breaks concepts into classes which encapsulate functionality. (SRP).

### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines)  needs some refactoring, and is mostly idiomatic.
