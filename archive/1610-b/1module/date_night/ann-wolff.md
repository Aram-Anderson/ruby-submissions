Notes:
* More testing needed, tests written demonstrate basic grasp of testing principles, but coverage is insufficient
* Health method missing
* Many long methods, nested elsif statements, opportunities to refactor

Score:

### 1. Test-Driven Development

* 2: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient
 
### 2. Functional Expectations

* 2: Application is missing one base expectation

### 3. Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application consistently breaks concepts into classes which encapsulate functionality. (SRP).

### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 2:  Application runs but the code has many long methods (>8 lines), has poorly named variables, needs significant refactoring, and is somewhat idiomatic.
