Notes:
* Strong integration tests, some stylistic tweaks needed
* Health missing 
* Opportunity to refactor some long classes. 
* Fundamentals of Ruby logic and SRP seem sound. 

Score:

### 1. Test-Driven Development
* 2: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient
 
### 2. Functional Expectations
* 2: Application is missing one base expectation

### 3. Breaking Logic into Components
* 3: Application consistently breaks concepts into classes which encapsulate functionality. (SRP).

### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style
* 2:  Application runs but the code has many long methods (>8 lines), has poorly named variables, needs significant refactoring, and is somewhat idiomatic.
