Notes: 
- 25 assertions = all passing
- Talked about seperation of responsibility. has a binary tree class only. 
- would like to see a node class to deal with the nodes

Score:

### 1. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality
 
### 2. Functional Expectations

* 4: Application fulfills all base expectations and two extensions

### 3. Breaking Logic into Components

* 2: Application makes use of some classes, but the divisions or encapsulation are unclear.

### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 2:  Application runs but the code has many long methods (>8 lines), has poorly named variables, needs significant refactoring, and is somewhat idiomatic.
