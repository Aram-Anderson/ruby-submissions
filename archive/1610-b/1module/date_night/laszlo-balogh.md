Notes:
* Implemented tree with Hash to manage some data collection. Would work better to use pure BST implementation
* Some tweaks would make testing more readable
* Opportunities to refactor large methods
* LOVE extraction of compare to new file. Next time, make it a module

Score:

### 1. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality
 
### 2. Functional Expectations

* 3: Application fulfills all base expectations

### 3. Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application consistently breaks concepts into classes which encapsulate functionality. (SRP).

### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 2:  Application runs but the code has many long methods (>8 lines), has poorly named variables, needs significant refactoring, and is somewhat idiomatic.
