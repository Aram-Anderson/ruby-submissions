Notes:

Scores:

### 1. Test-Driven Development

* 4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data, including edge cases
* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality
* 2: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient
* 1: Application does not have significant testing.

### 2. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 4: Application always breaks concepts into classes and methods which encapsulate functionality.
* 3: Application consistently breaks concepts into classes and methods which have appropriate scope and responsibilities (SRP).
* 2: Application makes use of some classes, but the divisions or encapsulation are unclear.
* 1: Application makes use of just a few huge methods to control the bulk of the functionality.


### 3. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 4:  Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, refactoring, and extensively uses idiomatic code.
* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines)  needs some refactoring, and is mostly idiomatic.
* 2:  Application runs but the code has many long methods (>8 lines), has poorly named variables, needs significant refactoring, and is somewhat idiomatic.
* 1:  Application generates syntax error or crashes during execution

### 4. Enumerable & Collections

* 4: Application consistently makes use of the best-choice Enumerable methods and collections
* 3: Application makes use of appropriate Enumerable methods and collections
* 2: Application only uses the most basic Enumerable techniques.
* 1: Application does not use enumerables.

### 5. Functional Expectations

* 4: Application fulfills all base expectations and one extension
* 3: Application fulfills all base expectations
* 2: Application is missing one base expectation
* 1: Application is missing more than one base expectation
