Notes: 
- 2 tests - 2 failures 
- The program was functioning without feedback in correct positions but all was in the mastermind file, no classes
- Talked about seperating responsibilities into classes and methods. 

Score:

### 1. Test-Driven Development

* 1: Application does not demonstrate strong use of TDD

### 2. REPL Interface and Game Functionality

* 2: Application's REPL has inconsistencies and/or there are errors in base gameplay

### 3. Breaking Logic into Components

* 1: Application makes use of just a few huge methods to control the bulk of the functionality.
 
### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 2:  Application runs but the code has many long methods (>8 lines) has poorly named variables, needs significant refactoring, and is somewhat idiomatic.

### 5. Enumerable & Collections

* 1: Application does not use enumerables.
