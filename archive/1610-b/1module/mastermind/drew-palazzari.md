Notes: 
- 8 tests - 1 failure 
- Would like to see seperation of responsibilities such as output messages. 
- Could break logic up a bit more into smaller methods.


Score:

### 1. Test-Driven Development

* 2: Application tests some components but has many gaps in coverage.

### 2. REPL Interface and Game Functionality

* 3: Application's REPL is clear and pleasant to use and application fulfills base expectations from the project spec

### 3. Breaking Logic into Components

* 2.5: Application makes use of some classes, but the divisions or encapsulation are unclear.
 
### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines)  needs some refactoring, and is mostly idiomatic.

### 5. Enumerable & Collections

* 3: Application makes use of appropriate Enumerable methods and collections
