Notes:
* didn't make use of strong TDD
* a lot was inside the mastermind class, think about what and how you could put things into separate classes
When thinking about how to divide things into separate classes, name things that the class does in english
whenever you use "and" that's probably a good sign you can pull it out. Example, the mastermind class has the things
you print out to the screen AND checks the inputs from the user AND ... etc etc
* Methods created to check user input were great


Score:

### 1. Test-Driven Development

* 1: Application does not demonstrate strong use of TDD

### 2. REPL Interface and Game Functionality

* 3: Application's REPL is clear and pleasant to use and application fulfills base expectations from the project spec

### 3. Breaking Logic into Components

* 2: Application makes use of some classes, but the divisions or encapsulation are unclear.

 
### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 2:  Application runs but the code has many long methods (>8 lines) has poorly named variables, needs significant refactoring, and is somewhat idiomatic.


### 5. Enumerable & Collections


* 3: Application makes use of appropriate Enumerable methods and collections
