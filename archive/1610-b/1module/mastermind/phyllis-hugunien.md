Repo:

Notes:

* Got things playable but didn't use testing
* REPL is playable
* Guess feedback isn't quite accurate
* Implementation has lots of good things happening with some chunks that are very complex
* Look to break out functionality to smaller pieces

Score:

### 1. Test-Driven Development

* 1: Application does not demonstrate strong use of TDD

### 2. REPL Interface and Game Functionality

* 2: Application's REPL has inconsistencies and/or there are errors in base gameplay

### 3. Breaking Logic into Components

* 2: Application makes use of some classes, but the divisions or encapsulation are unclear.

### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 2:  Application runs but the code has many long methods (>8 lines) has poorly named variables, needs significant refactoring, and is somewhat idiomatic.

### 5. Enumerable & Collections

* 3: Application makes use of appropriate Enumerable methods and collections
