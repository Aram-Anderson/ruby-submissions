Repo:

Notes: 
- Got a little turned around when trying to pull together multiple classes
- Seperate the files better into lib and test and delete inactive files 
- TDD could be stronger and test things that need to be tested, not just simple things

Score:

### 1. Test-Driven Development

* 1: Application does not demonstrate strong use of TDD

### 2. REPL Interface and Game Functionality

* 1: Application's REPL has several issues or application fails to run

### 3. Breaking Logic into Components

* 2: Application makes use of some classes, but the divisions or encapsulation are unclear.
 
### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 2:  Application runs but the code has many long methods (>8 lines) has poorly named variables, needs significant refactoring, and is somewhat idiomatic.

### 5. Enumerable & Collections

* 2: Application only uses the most basic Enumerable techniques.
