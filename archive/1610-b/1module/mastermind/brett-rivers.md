Notes:
* Not strong testing
* Look at how to craft methods so that they take arguments and return things to help with your testing.
* WRite out what a class does on paper in order to help organize your code into separate classes more easily.
* Completed project, did difficulty
* Many methods were way too long- think about how to separate them 


Score:

### 1. Test-Driven Development

* 1: Application does not demonstrate strong use of TDD

### 2. REPL Interface and Game Functionality

* 4: Application's REPL goes above and beyond expectations and application includes one or more extensions

### 3. Breaking Logic into Components

* 1: Application makes use of just a few huge methods to control the bulk of the functionality.
 
### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 2:  Application runs but the code has many long methods (>8 lines) has poorly named variables, needs significant refactoring, and is somewhat idiomatic.


### 5. Enumerable & Collections


* 3: Application makes use of appropriate Enumerable methods and collections
