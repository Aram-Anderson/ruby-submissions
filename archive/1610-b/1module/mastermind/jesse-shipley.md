No
tes: 
- 9 tests - all passing 
- Talked about seperation of responsibility - maybe an outputmessages class etc. 
- breaking down methods a little further 
- testing on a smaller unit level basis
- keep an eye out for instance variables and usage

Score:

### 1. Test-Driven Development

* 2: Application tests some components but has many gaps in coverage.

### 2. REPL Interface and Game Functionality

* 2.5: Application's REPL has inconsistencies and/or there are errors in base gameplay - some missing features 

### 3. Breaking Logic into Components

* 2: Application makes use of some classes, but the divisions or encapsulation are unclear.
 
### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 2.5:  Application runs but the code has many long methods (>8 lines) has high usuage of instance variables, needs refactoring, and is somewhat idiomatic.

### 5. Enumerable & Collections

* 3: Application makes use of appropriate Enumerable methods and collections
