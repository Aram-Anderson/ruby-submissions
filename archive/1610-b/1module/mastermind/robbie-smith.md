Notes:
* 23 tests one error
* 94 percent coverage
* Project was well divided and organized into classes that made sense.
* Try avoiding methods that just modify instance variables, and think about more how you would get methods to send and receive messages. Watch Sandi Metz' conference talk: Nothing is Something.
* Would like to have seen a little more in depth testing, especially with edge cases
* did extensions, used colors, used Kimble gem



Score:

### 1. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality, but has some gaps in coverage or leaves edge cases untested.

### 2. REPL Interface and Game Functionality

* 4: Application's REPL goes above and beyond expectations and application includes one or more extensions

### 3. Breaking Logic into Components

* 4: Application always breaks concepts into classes and methods which encapsulate functionality.
 
### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style


* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines)  needs some refactoring, and is mostly idiomatic.

### 5. Enumerable & Collections

* 3: Application makes use of appropriate Enumerable methods and collections
