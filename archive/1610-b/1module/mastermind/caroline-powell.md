Notes:
* started on tuesday
* great progress for having so little time
* just the one class
* no tests
* some long methods
* think about how to have methods take arguments and return values
* good start on how to write tests
* game works, no extensions

Score:

### 1. Test-Driven Development

* 1: Application does not demonstrate strong use of TDD

### 2. REPL Interface and Game Functionality

* 3: Application's REPL is clear and pleasant to use and application fulfills base expectations from the project spec

### 3. Breaking Logic into Components

* 2: Application makes use of some classes, but the divisions or encapsulation are unclear.
 
### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 2:  Application runs but the code has many long methods (>8 lines) has poorly named variables, needs significant refactoring, and is somewhat idiomatic.


### 5. Enumerable & Collections

* 3: Application makes use of appropriate Enumerable methods and collections
