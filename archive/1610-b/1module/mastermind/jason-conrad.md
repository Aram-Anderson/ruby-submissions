Notes:
* 6 tests, all passing 42 percent coverage
* Opportunitites to refactor
* Look at making methods accept arguments and return values in order to make testing easier.
* Computer is the master class, and all functionality lives with in it.
* Would like to have seen more division of classes, perhaps one for the board, one for messages, another one for 
the calculation of guesses and the secret. 
* Avoid using so many instance variables, and setting them to all have the attr_accessor

Score:

### 1. Test-Driven Development

* 2: Application tests some components but has many gaps in coverage.


### 2. REPL Interface and Game Functionality


* 3: Application's REPL is clear and pleasant to use and application fulfills base expectations from the project spec

### 3. Breaking Logic into Components

* 2: Application makes use of some classes, but the divisions or encapsulation are unclear.

 
### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines)  needs some refactoring, and is mostly idiomatic.

### 5. Enumerable & Collections

* 3: Application makes use of appropriate Enumerable methods and collections
