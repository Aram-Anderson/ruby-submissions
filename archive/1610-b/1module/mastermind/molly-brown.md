Notes:
* No effective testing
* Project was done in 3 nights, pretty good progress.
* there is the start of some organization
* think about how to start pulling methods out to their own objects, organize things by function or theme


Score:

### 1. Test-Driven Development

* 1: Application does not demonstrate strong use of TDD

### 2. REPL Interface and Game Functionality

* 2: Application's REPL has inconsistencies and/or there are errors in base gameplay


### 3. Breaking Logic into Components

* 2: Application makes use of some classes, but the divisions or encapsulation are unclear.

 
### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines)  needs some refactoring, and is mostly idiomatic.

### 5. Enumerable & Collections

* 3: Application makes use of appropriate Enumerable methods and collections
