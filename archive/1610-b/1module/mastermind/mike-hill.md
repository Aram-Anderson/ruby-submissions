Repo:

Notes:

* 8 tests all pass
* Tests are simple but there are a few good things happening
* The implementation shows care and is overall good
* Keep looking for small methods and classes/modules to extract and test those
* Overall a good setup for the next project

Score:

### 1. Test-Driven Development

* 2: Application tests some components but has many gaps in coverage.

### 2. REPL Interface and Game Functionality

* 3: Application's REPL is clear and pleasant to use and application fulfills base expectations from the project spec

### 3. Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application consistently breaks concepts into classes which encapsulate functionality. (SRP)

### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines)  needs some refactoring, and is mostly idiomatic.

### 5. Enumerable & Collections

* 3: Application makes use of appropriate Enumerable methods and collections
