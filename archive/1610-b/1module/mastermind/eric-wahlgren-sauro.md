Notes:
* six tests
* In the messages module, there is too much going on, move the puts out and just have the methods accept arguments and return strings
* there is one class that does everything, more organization will lead to better testing.
* remember that methods ideally will accept arguments and return something - this makes testing easier, avoid methods that only modify internal state unless it is explicitly necessary

Score:

### 1. Test-Driven Development

* 2: Application tests some components but has many gaps in coverage.


### 2. REPL Interface and Game Functionality

* 4: Application's REPL goes above and beyond expectations and application includes one or more extensions

### 3. Breaking Logic into Components


* 2: Application makes use of some classes, but the divisions or encapsulation are unclear.\
 
### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style


* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines)  needs some refactoring, and is mostly idiomatic.

### 5. Enumerable & Collections

* 3: Application makes use of appropriate Enumerable methods and collections
