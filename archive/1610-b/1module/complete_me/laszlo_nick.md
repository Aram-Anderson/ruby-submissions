* Really good job breaking out into logical components.
* Though there are small methods, looks like there is a bit of redundancy and
could combine multiple methods into one
* Tests are really great, but still a little redudancy here
* Liked the explicit returns in only the methods where it made sense
* Shoes extension is really neat
