Notes:

* Tests have some failures after refactoring and removing methods
* Tests are very detailed and closely tied to implementation
* Haven't used the spec harness
* Implementation is strong but could use more abstractions
* Good code for refactoring with a mentor
* Keep the "language" of the app consistent unless it needs to be different
* Spec harness passes

Scores:

### 1. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

### 2. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application consistently breaks concepts into classes and methods which have appropriate scope and responsibilities (SRP).

### 3. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines)  needs some refactoring, and is mostly idiomatic.

### 4. Enumerable & Collections

* 3: Application makes use of appropriate Enumerable methods and collections

### 5. Functional Expectations

* 3: Application fulfills all base expectations
