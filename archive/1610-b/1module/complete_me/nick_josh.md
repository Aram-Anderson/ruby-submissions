Notes:

* About 35 tests across files
* Need to use the spec harness
* Three part implementation is good
* Good tests on node and whole CompleteMe
* Trie is mostly tested through CompleteMe
* Would like to see a bit more abstraction in the implementation
* Spec harness: passes
* Built a shoes GUI

Scores:

### 1. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

### 2. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application consistently breaks concepts into classes and methods which have appropriate scope and responsibilities (SRP).

### 3. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines)  needs some refactoring, and is mostly idiomatic.

### 4. Enumerable & Collections

* 3: Application makes use of appropriate Enumerable methods and collections

### 5. Functional Expectations

* 4: Application fulfills all base expectations and one extension
