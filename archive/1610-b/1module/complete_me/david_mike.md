Notes:

* Overall great job
* Room for improvement to break out if/else statements into separate methods
* Discussed methods that are doing one thing OR another. Could break those out
 into its own for SRP
* Good job testing for edge cases
* Did the address extension

Scores:

### 1. Test-Driven Development

* 4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data, including edge cases

### 2. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3.5: Application consistently breaks concepts into classes and methods which have appropriate scope and responsibilities (SRP).


### 3. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3.5:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines)  needs some refactoring, and is mostly idiomatic.

### 4. Enumerable & Collections

* 4: Application consistently makes use of the best-choice Enumerable methods and collections

### 5. Functional Expectations

* 4: Application fulfills all base expectations and one extension
