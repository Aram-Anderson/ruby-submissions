Notes:
* Solid test coverage, would love to see some of these attribute tests separated into separate tests
* Completed through i4
* Nice use of some modules; could go further with this with extracting SA functionality into additional modules/classes
* Ruby style consistently solid
* Consistent use of best-choice enumerables

Scores:
### 1. Functional Expectations
* 3: Application implements iterations 0, 1, 2, 3, and either 4 or 5

### 2. Test-Driven Development
* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components
* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style
* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

### 5. Enumerable & Collections
* 4: Application consistently makes use of the best-choice Enumerable methods

### 6. Code Sanitation
The output from `rake sanitation:all` shows...
* 4: Zero complaints
