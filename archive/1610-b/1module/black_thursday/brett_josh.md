Notes:
* Solid testing suite
* Testing: some redundant assertions, watch line length in tests
* Completed through i4
* Some opportunities to extract classes and functionality into modules, overall solid job with division of responsibilities between classes and methods
* Consistent use of best-choice enumerables
* Some opportunities for refactoring (unnecessary local vars, extracting methods into sep classes), but overall _strong_ effort toward organization
* Zero (0) sanitation errors

Scores:

### 1. Functional Expectations
* 3: Application implements iterations 0, 1, 2, 3, and either 4 or 5

### 2. Test-Driven Development
* 4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components
* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style
* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

### 5. Enumerable & Collections
* 4: Application consistently makes use of the best-choice Enumerable methods

### 6. Code Sanitation
The output from `rake sanitation:all` shows...
