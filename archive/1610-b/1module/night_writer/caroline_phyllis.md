Notes:
- Able to get english to braille but did not go back the other way.
- 3 tests - none passing 
- Talked about classes for the fileio and other files 
- Talked about a bit of refactoring
- Want to look into a runner file and how that functions with the nightwriter

Scores:



### 1. Test-Driven Development

* 1: Application does not have significant testing.

### 2. Breaking Logic into Components

* 2: Application makes use of some classes, but the divisions or encapsulation are unclear.

### 3. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 2:  Application runs but the code has many long methods (>8 lines), has poorly named variables, needs significant refactoring, and is somewhat idiomatic.

### 4. Overall Functionality

* 1: Application only converts to Braille or from Braille
