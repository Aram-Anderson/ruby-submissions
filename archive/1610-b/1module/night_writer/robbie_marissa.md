Notes:
* Rake test file
* 26 tests 749 assertions 
* 100 percent test coverage
* used in enumerables in test
* Recursive approach was super cool
* Read and write are separated, might belong together in a single class/module/thing
* try to have methods take arguments instead of reading an instance variable



Scores:



### 1. Test-Driven Development

* 4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data, including edge cases

### 2. Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application consistently breaks concepts into classes and methods which have appropriate scope and responsibilities (SRP).

### 3. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines)  needs some refactoring, and is mostly idiomatic.

### 4. Overall Functionality
