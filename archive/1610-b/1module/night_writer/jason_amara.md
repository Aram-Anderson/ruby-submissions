Notes:
* Successfully converts either way
* 11 tests, one failing test
* FILE IO tests arent meaningful
* Remember that each method should have its own tests.
* Remember to add edge cases for tests
* Numerous methods are missing corresponding tests
* I like the fact that the dictionaries are broken, out but use constants and test it.
* Watch CRs and spacing, use of them makes code more readable.


Scores:



### 1. Test-Driven Development

* 2: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient


### 2. Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application consistently breaks concepts into classes and methods which have appropriate scope and responsibilities (SRP).

### 3. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines)  needs some refactoring, and is mostly idiomatic.

### 4. Overall Functionality

* 2: Application converts to Braille and back successfully
