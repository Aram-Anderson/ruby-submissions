Notes:
* Tests written but fail on execution all except the translator text
* Special characters completed
* Try not to have methods that simply modify an instance variable
* Does translate have any state? What should get stored in state
* there's a lot of instance variables that are unnecessary

Scores:



### 1. Test-Driven Development

* 2: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient


### 2. Breaking Logic into Components

* 2: Application makes use of some classes, but the divisions or encapsulation are unclear.


### 3. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 2:  Application runs but the code has many long methods (>8 lines), has poorly named variables, needs significant refactoring, and is somewhat idiomatic.


### 4. Overall Functionality

* 2: Application converts to Braille and back successfully
