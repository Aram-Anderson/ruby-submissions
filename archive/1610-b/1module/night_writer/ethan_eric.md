Notes:
- 19 tests - all passing 
- Decent refactoring to be done 
- functioning with an extension 
- talked about variables at length

Scores:



### 1. Test-Driven Development

* 2.5: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient

### 2. Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application consistently breaks concepts into classes and methods which have appropriate scope and responsibilities (SRP).

### 3. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines)  needs some refactoring, and is mostly idiomatic.

### 4. Overall Functionality

* 3: Application follows the complete spec and one extension
