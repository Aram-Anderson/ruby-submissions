Notes:

Scores:
* Able to convert to braille to english and vice versa
* File IO has too much logic in it, would have liked to seen the logic broken
 out into translator or wherever it would have made the most sense.
* A few classes in translator class have a lot of room to break out into smaller
 methods
* Discussed using constants in the future, but liked that it was at least broken
 out into its own class

### 1. Test-Driven Development

* 3.5: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

### 2. Breaking Logic into Components

* 2: Application makes use of some classes, but the divisions or encapsulation are unclear.

### 3. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines)  needs some refactoring, and is mostly idiomatic.

### 4. Overall Functionality

* 3: Application follows the complete spec and one extension
