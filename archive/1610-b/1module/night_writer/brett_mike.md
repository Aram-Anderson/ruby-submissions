Repo: github.com/riverswb/night_writer

Notes:
* 20 tests, 20 assertions
* All tests pass
* Program worked, did not complete extension
* Would have liked to have seen filenames passed to the file reading and writing
* Reading and write should really belong in the same class/module. Look into class methods for FileIO stuff
* night reader/reader night writer/writer has a lot of redundnacy
* generally good, work on organization and when to use classes, how to organize in classes


Scores:



### 1. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

### 2. Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application consistently breaks concepts into classes and methods which have appropriate scope and responsibilities (SRP).

### 3. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines)  needs some refactoring, and is mostly idiomatic.

### 4. Overall Functionality

* 2: Application converts to Braille and back successfully
