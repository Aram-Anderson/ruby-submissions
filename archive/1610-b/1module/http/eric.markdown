Notes:

* 21 tests all pass
* Struggled with the testing and getting into a deeper level of functionality
* HTTP responses need better formatting / compliance for things like the "hello" functionality
* Game functionality works
* Shutdown works
* Implementation is generally broken into components but some borders between components are fuzzy


Scores:

### 1. Overall Functionality

* 3: Application implements iterations 0 - 4

### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 2: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality but leaves many common edge cases untested.

### 4. Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities
