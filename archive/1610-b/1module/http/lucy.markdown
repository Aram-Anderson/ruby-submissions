Notes:
* 21 tests
* Visual feedback with the server which was great
* generally classes are well defined
* in the server, there are a few methods which are doing entirely too much - think about how you would pull them out
* used a hash to store the dictionary, very efficient lookup


Scores:

### 1. Overall Functionality

* 2: Application implements iterations 0 - 3ting Iterations 0-5

### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

### 3. Test-Driven Development


* 3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality and some edge cases, but fails to break out component objects/tests.

### 4. Breaking Logic into Components


* 3: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities
