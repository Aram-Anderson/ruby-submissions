Repo:

Notes:

* 41 tests plus 16 server/faraday tests
* In the tests and implementation we see small methods with well defined names and clearly implemented code
* Room for a bit of edge case work with things like the game
* Implementation shows good parallel interfaces to similar objects and overall very good componentization

Scores:

### 1. Overall Functionality

* 3: Application implements iterations 0 - 4

### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 4:  Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and refactoring

### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality and some edge cases, but fails to break out component objects/tests.

### 4. Breaking Logic into Components

* 4: Application effectively breaks logical components apart with clear intent and usage
