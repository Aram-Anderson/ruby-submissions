Notes:
* 18 tests, all passes
* there's a rakefile!
* Classes are overall well separated.
* Some small areas to refactor, think about predicate methods, think about what can or should be instantiated.


Scores:

### 1. Overall Functionality

* 2: Application implements iterations 0 - 3

### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality and some edge cases, but fails to break out component objects/tests.

### 4. Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities
