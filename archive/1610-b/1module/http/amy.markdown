Notes:

* Six tests, all pass.
* Working code uses a god class with very long method(s).
* Not working code shows things separated well. 
* Iterations 0-3 complete, game has been started but does not work.
* Testing only covers word searching, remember to have tests that cover other methods
and other branches of conditionals that you have in your code


Scores:

### 1. Overall Functionality

* 2: Application implements iterations 0 - 3

### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 2:  Application runs but the code has many long methods (>8 lines) and needs significant refactoring


### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 1: Application does not demonstrate strong use of TDD

### 4. Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities
