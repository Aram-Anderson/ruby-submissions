Notes:
* 31 tests, all pass
* Broke dictionary out to separate class
* memoization! wow.
* Robbie has clearly been reading a lot of POODR and has been incorporating the ideas in there.


Scores:

### 1. Overall Functionality

* 3: Application implements iterations 0 - 4

### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality and some edge cases, but fails to break out component objects/tests.

### 4. Breaking Logic into Components

* 4: Application effectively breaks logical components apart with clear intent and usage
