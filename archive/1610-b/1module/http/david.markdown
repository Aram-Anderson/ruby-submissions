Notes:
- got through it 5 but iteration 3 is not working. 
- 37 tests - all passing 
- server and output could use refactoring
- solid push

Scores:

### 1. Overall Functionality

* 3: Application implements iterations 0 - 4

**Echo/Foxtrot Note:** Requirements listed are for *Foxtrot* pairs -- Echo requirements are shifted by 1 additional iteration -- So a 3 for Echo requires completing Iterations 0-5

### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 2.5:  Application runs but the code has many long methods (>8 lines) and needs significant refactoring

### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality and some edge cases, but fails to break out component objects/tests.

### 4. Breaking Logic into Components

* 4: Application effectively breaks logical components apart with clear intent and usage
