Notes: 
- 29 tests - all passing - used faraday
- the http class was all a long file no methods or classes 
- talked about taking some classes out of other classes. nested classes


Scores:

### 1. Overall Functionality

* 3: Application implements iterations 0 - 4

**Echo/Foxtrot Note:** Requirements listed are for *Foxtrot* pairs -- Echo requirements are shifted by 1 additional iteration -- So a 3 for Echo requires completing Iterations 0-5

### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 2.5:  Application runs but the code has many long methods (>8 lines) and needs significant refactoring

### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality and some edge cases, but fails to break out component objects/tests.

### 4. Breaking Logic into Components

* 2: Application has some logical components but divisions of responsibility are inconsistent or unclear and/or there is a "God" object taking too much responsibility
