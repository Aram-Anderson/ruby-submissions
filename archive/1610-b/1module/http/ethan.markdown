Notes:
- 17 tests - all passing 
- tests need to be more robust 
- some general methods that we talked about including the output and headers method in the output class

Scores:

### 1. Overall Functionality

* 2: Application implements iterations 0 - 3

**Echo/Foxtrot Note:** Requirements listed are for *Foxtrot* pairs -- Echo requirements are shifted by 1 additional iteration -- So a 3 for Echo requires completing Iterations 0-5

### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 2: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality but leaves many common edge cases untested.

### 4. Breaking Logic into Components

* 4: Application effectively breaks logical components apart with clear intent and usage
