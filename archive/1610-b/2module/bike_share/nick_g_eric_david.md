## Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

### 1. Functional Expectations

* 3.5: Application fulfills base expectations

### 2. ActiveRecord

* 4: Appropriate ActiveRecord methods are used to query the database and live in the appropriate model. No Ruby is used to organize data after database queries.

### 3. User Experience and Conventions

* 4: Project uses Sinatra methods and ERB templates to display both resources and non-resource related views with appropriate routes, and HTTP verbs. All functionality can be accessed in the application where expected based on the spec. User experience is exceptional ('client ready') and all pieces of the application can be accessed without entering addresses manually in the nav bar.

### 4. Code Organization/Quality

* 3: Some logic not related specifically to HTTP requests/resesponses remains in the main application file. Some methods may be slightly long, or follow unexpected patterns. Limited logic may leak into the views.

### 5. Testing

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration/feature tests

### 6. Working Collaboratively

* 2: Sporadic use of branches, pull requests, and/or project-management tool.
