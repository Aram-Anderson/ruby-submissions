## Rubric

You will be subjectively graded by an instructor on the following criteria:

### Specification Adherence

- 4: Application implements all functionality as defined, with no bugs, and one extension
- **3: Application implements all functionality as defined, but some bugs or strange behavior where features intersect**
- 2: Application is missing required functionality, deviates significantly from the spec, or serious bugs prevent features from being usable
- 1: Application is missing a significant portion of functionality

### Testing

- **4: All functionality is covered by tests. Appropriate mix of unit and integration tests. Sad path testing in both unit and integration tests.**
- 3: All functionality is covered by tests. Appropriate mix of unit and integration tests.
- 2: More functionality implemented than tested or only uses one test type
- 1: Team fails to effectively test the application.

### HTML/UI

- 4: Team put some effort into styling. HTML features unique IDs, classes and data attributes for DOM traversal.
- **3: Application is not confusing to use. HTML classes and IDs are kebab case.**
- 2: HTML is greatly lacking in standards compliance. UI is confusing or very buggy.
- 1: Application is unusable

### JS syntax and Style

- **4: Javascript features explicit DOM traversal (not using closest), demonstrates great OOP concepts, and uses named and anonymous functions when appropriate**
- 3: Code logically divided into files. Developer can show examples of some SOLID concepts. Attention payed to indentation and naming.
- 2: Javascript is noticeably lacking in the above concepts.
- 1: Team has not applied any style concepts from class or from Ruby background

### Git Workflow

- **4: Team uses master for production, and creates a feature branch for each card worked on. Team is using pull requests with good context and conversation**
- 3: Team is using the feature branches for small groups of cards, and has a pull request for each feature. Developers that aren't on the team have commented on PRs.
- 2: Team fails to use feature branches, or isn't using pull requests
- 1: All code is committed to master

### Project Management

- **4: Team is using a project management tool and updating their progress daily. Team is approving each other's  work. Team is documenting conversations and conclusions on relevant cards.**
- 3: Team is using a project management tool to keep their project organized. Nearly every card has been turned into user stories.
- 2: Team is using a project management tool but didn't update the progress frequently. Many cards have no changes made to them
- 1: Team failed to use a project management tool to track its progress.

### Risk Taking

Adhering to any of these additional specifications will allow you to increase one score above:

- All functionality is part of a class, written using ES6
- No Libraries (except for testing). All JavaScript functionality is your own.
