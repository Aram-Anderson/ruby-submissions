Notes:
* 7 tests all passing
* recursive technique used in the BST
* missing node tests

### 1. Test-Driven Development

* 2: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient


### 2. Functional Expectations

* 1: Application is missing more than one base expectation

### 3. Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application consistently breaks concepts into classes which encapsulate functionality. (SRP).

### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines)  needs some refactoring, and is mostly idiomatic.
