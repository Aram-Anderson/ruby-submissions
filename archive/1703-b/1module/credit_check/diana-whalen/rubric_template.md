## Evaluation Rubric

Name: Diana

Assessor: Lauren

Notes:

* While your solution is compact and does work, let's try to work on more modular, readable code.
* Ideally, this would be a class-based solution with multiple instance methods, each responsible for its own segment of the logic that is currently chained together in your solution.
* Would love to discuss this more in person to hear your descision making throughout and talk through why separate methods would be best used here.
* Again, this does work, but it is in the opposite direction of the modular, readable, scalable code we're looking to produce here.

The project will be assessed with the following guidelines:

### 1. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 4:  Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and refactoring
* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring
* **2:  Application runs but the code has long methods, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and needs significant refactoring**
* 1:  Application generates syntax error or crashes during execution

### 2. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 4: Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility
* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP
* 2: Application shows some effort to break logic into components, but the divisions are inconsistent or unclear
* **1: Application logic shows poor decomposition with too much logic mashed together**

### 3. Functional Expectations

* **4: Application meets all requirements, and implements one extension properly.**
* 3: Application meets all requirements as laid out per the specification.
* 2: Application runs, but does not work properly, or does not meet specifications.
* 1: Application does not run, crashes on start.
