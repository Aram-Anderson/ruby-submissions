## Evaluation Rubric

Assessor: Mike

* For something like this think about how you would send messages from and to
methods to avoid using an instance variable.
* Attributes should be stored in instance variables, is the number an
attribute of the CreditCheck class?
* Avoid using the .map! method, it's generally preferable to create a new
collection rather than modifying an existing one.
* Convention is that if a method ends with ? it returns only a true or a false.
* Overall, VERY clear and readable code.
* In your double odd digits method think about how you can do this without
setting an empty array and shovelling into it.
