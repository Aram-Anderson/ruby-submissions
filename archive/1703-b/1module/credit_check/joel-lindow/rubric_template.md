## Evaluation Rubric

Assessor: Mike

* Only version with comments runs.
* would like to have seen use of a class but at the least methods to decompose
the problem.
* Watch whitespace, and carriage returns. Indentation should be only 2 spaces.
* what is the empty string on line 54 for?
* Avoid using single letter variable names
* Is there an enumerable you can use instead of using the pattern of a loop
that shovels individual values into an empty array

The project will be assessed with the following guidelines:

### 1. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 2:  Application runs but the code has long methods, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and needs significant refactoring

### 2. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 1: Application logic shows poor decomposition with too much logic mashed together

### 3. Functional Expectations

* 3: Application meets all requirements as laid out per the specification.
