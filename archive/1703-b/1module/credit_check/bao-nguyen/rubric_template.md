## Evaluation Rubric

Assessor: Mike

* Used a class, great!
* I like how you've decomposed everything into granular methods.
* Overall, a good implementation, but there are a few areas I'd like you to
look into.
* In your next project, look at how predicate methods can make dealing with
conditionals easier.
* Try to avoid nested conditionals, if you have to nest, pull out the inner
conditional into another method.

The project will be assessed with the following guidelines:

### 1. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

### 2. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

### 3. Functional Expectations

* 3: Application meets all requirements as laid out per the specification.
