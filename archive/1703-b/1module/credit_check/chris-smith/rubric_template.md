## Evaluation Rubric

Assessor: Mike

* Oooh, tests!
* Put an newline between tests.
* You don't have to set variables in each method, for example the contents
of your stringify method can just be `number.to_s` instead of
`number = number.to_s`. Recall that the last line evaluated in a method is what
gets returned.
* Ditto reverse number, you can just do `stringify(number).reverse`
* Avoid using ternaries, especially if they are in the block of an enumerable
it's just easier to read and clearer.

The project will be assessed with the following guidelines:

### 1. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

### 2. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 4: Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility

### 3. Functional Expectations

* 4: Application meets all requirements, and implements one extension properly.
