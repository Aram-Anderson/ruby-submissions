## Evaluation Rubric

Assessor: Mike

* Would like to have seen an implementation that used classes.
* Though your implementation is correct and working, code should not be lumped
into one method - at this point methods should not be longer than 8 lines.
* A good way to determine if a method is too long is by describing what it
does in english. If you use the word "and" too many times, that is an
opportunity to break out functionality into another separate method.
* From lines 5-10 this is a pattern that happens a lot, is there are more
efficient way to do this using an enumerable?
* Same with lines 13-26.
* On line 32, look at how you can simplify complex conditionals like this
with predicate methods.

The project will be assessed with the following guidelines:

### 1. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 2.5: Application runs but code has long methods, and needs refactoring.

### 2. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 1: Application logic shows poor decomposition with too much logic mashed together

### 3. Functional Expectations

* 4: Application meets all requirements, and implements one extension properly.
