## Evaluation Rubric

Name: Natalia

Assessor: Lauren

Notes:

* Fun use of gets for command-line interaction
* I'd aim for a class-based solution in future project iterations - for this, that would look like initializing a new `CreditCheck` class with a credit card number that is then validated
* I would more immediately aim for capturing your program's logic into methods that have a single responsibility. This pays off huge in the long run for code reusability, readability, and testing
* Good use of enumerables throughout

The project will be assessed with the following guidelines:

### 1. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 4:  Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and refactoring
* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring
* **2:  Application runs but the code has long methods, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and needs significant refactoring**
* 1:  Application generates syntax error or crashes during execution

### 2. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 4: Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility
* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP
* **2: Application shows some effort to break logic into components, but the divisions are inconsistent or unclear**
* 1: Application logic shows poor decomposition with too much logic mashed together

### 3. Functional Expectations

* **4: Application meets all requirements, and implements one extension properly.**
* 3: Application meets all requirements as laid out per the specification.
* 2: Application runs, but does not work properly, or does not meet specifications.
* 1: Application does not run, crashes on start.
