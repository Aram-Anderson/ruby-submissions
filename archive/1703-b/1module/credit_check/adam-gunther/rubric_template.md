## Evaluation Rubric

Assessor: Mike

* Would like to have seen your implementation use classes.
* The luhn_algorithm method is implemented correctly, but is entirely too long
and does too much. Some of the functionality within can be broken out into
supporting methods. At this point in your coding career, try to keep methods
under six lines of length. A good way to be able to determine if you need to
break out functionality is to say out loud what a method does. If you feel
like you are using the word "and" too much, you can probably break it out into
another method.
* In particular, each branch of the conditionals can be broken out to their
own methods.
* Can you think of an enumerable that would have made this task easier instead
of using an until loop?

The project will be assessed with the following guidelines:

### 1. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 2.5: Long methods and some refactoring is necessary.

### 2. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

### 3. Functional Expectations

* 3: Application meets all requirements as laid out per the specification.
