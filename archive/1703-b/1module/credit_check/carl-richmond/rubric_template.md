## Evaluation Rubric

Assessor: Mike

* Would like to have seen a class and decomposition using methods.
* How would you have implemented this using enumerables and not a while loop
to do the heavy lifting?
* Your implementation works, but it's essential that code you write in the
future implements methods and decomposition in order to ensure that you
are meeting SRP, DRY, and allowing you to reuse code.

The project will be assessed with the following guidelines:

### 1. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 2.5: Application has no methods and could use refactoring.

### 2. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 1: Application logic shows poor decomposition with too much logic mashed together

### 3. Functional Expectations

* 3: Application meets all requirements as laid out per the specification.
