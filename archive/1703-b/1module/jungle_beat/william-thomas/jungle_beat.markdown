Notes:
* Complete up to iteration 
* Default to not using attr_accessor and attr_reader - only give access as necessary
* count and to_string should iterate and build a result, not modify an instance variable
* Avoid using ternary statements



## Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

### 1. Functional Expectations

* 1: Application is missing more than one base expectation

### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

### 5. Looping *or* Recursion

* 3: Application makes effective use of loop/recursion techniques
