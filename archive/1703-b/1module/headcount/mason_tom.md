Notes:

* 77 tests all passing
* Complete through I4
* Some opportunities to refactor, but clear that a lot of time was spent
making the code clean and good ruby.


## Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following guidelines:

### 1. Functional Expectations

* 2: Application has some missing functionality but no crashes

### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

### 5. Enumerable & Collections

* 3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods

### 6. Code Sanitation

The output from `rake sanitation:all` shows...

* 4: Zero complaints
* 3: Five or fewer complaints
* 2: Six to ten complaints
* 1: More than ten complaints
