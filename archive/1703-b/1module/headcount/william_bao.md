Notes:

* 53 tests, one failure
* Overall strong project, some oddness with structure with multiple classes
sharing a file.
* Some longish methods - break out parts into their own methods to help with
readability and mutability.

## Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following guidelines:

### 1. Functional Expectations

* 3: Application fulfills expectations of Iterations 0 - 4 *as well as* one of Iterations 5 or 6

### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

### 5. Enumerable & Collections

* 3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods

### 6. Code Sanitation

The output from `rake sanitation:all` shows...

* 4: Zero complaints
