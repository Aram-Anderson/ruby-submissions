Notes:
* Runner does not run
* Code uses modules, expand that idea to the character map, look into constants
* repetition of code between decrypt and encrypt
* logic of the encryption is sound, though many things are hard coded, such as
key and date

### 1. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality, but has some gaps in coverage or leaves edge cases untested.

### 3. Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities

### 4. Overall Functionality

* 1: Application is missing two operations or crashes during normal usage
