Notes:
* 35 tests, all passing
* be careful to make sure that your app meets the spec exactly
* I like how your methods decrypt and encrypt
* Overall good testing, would like to have seen edge case
* Some opportunities to refactor, and pull things out to methods and separate
classes



### 1. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality, but has some gaps in coverage or leaves edge cases untested.

### 3. Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities

### 4. Overall Functionality

* 3: Application encrypts, decrypts, and cracks files as described
