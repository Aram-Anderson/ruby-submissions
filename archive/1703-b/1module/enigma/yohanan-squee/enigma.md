Notes:
* 45 tests, 15 failing
* Great use of modules
* look into how to use constants to store information that does not change
* logic broken up well
* application does not run



### 1. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality, but has some gaps in coverage or leaves edge cases untested.

### 3. Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities

### 4. Overall Functionality

* 1: Application is missing two operations or crashes during normal usage
