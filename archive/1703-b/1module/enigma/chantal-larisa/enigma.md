Notes:

* encrypt, decrypt working
* good class based organization
* encrypt, decrypt methods in enigma could be separate classes, then broken to separate methods
* 98% test coverage
* set up simplecov and rakefile to run all tests

### 1. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 4:  Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and refactoring
* **3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.**
* 2:  Application runs but the code has many long methods (>8 lines) and needs significant refactoring
* 1:  Application generates syntax error or crashes during execution

### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration
* **3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality, but has some gaps in coverage or leaves edge cases untested.**
* 2: Application tests some components but has many gaps in coverage.
* 1: Application does not demonstrate strong use of TDD

### 3. Breaking Logic into Components

* 4: Application effectively breaks logical components apart with clear intent and usage
* **3: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities**
* 2: Application has some logical components but divisions of responsibility are inconsistent or unclear and/or there is a "God" object taking too much responsibility
* 1: Application logic shows poor decomposition with too much logic mashed together

### 4. Overall Functionality

* 4: Application follows the complete spec and one extension
* 3: Application encrypts, decrypts, and cracks files as described
* **2: Application is missing one of the three operations**
* 1: Application is missing two operations or crashes during normal usage
