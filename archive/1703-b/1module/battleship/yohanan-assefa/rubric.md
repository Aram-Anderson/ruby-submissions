Notes:

* Object separation is pretty solid. Good attempts at single responsibility.
* Application crashes when running.
* Ruby looks good.


### 1. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 4:  Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and refactoring
* **3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring**
* 2:  Application runs but the code has many long methods (>8 lines) and needs significant refactoring
* 1:  Application generates syntax error or crashes during execution

### 2. Enumerable & Collections

* 4: Application consistently makes use of the best-choice Enumerable methods
* **3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of several Enumerable techniques**
* 2: Application demonstrates functional knowledge of Enumerable but only uses the most basic techniques
* 1: Application demonstrates deficiencies with Enumerable and struggles with collections

### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration
* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests
* **2: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient**
* 1: Application does not demonstrate strong use of TDD

### 4. Git Workflow

* PASS:  Developer demonstrates mastery of git and GitHub; commits with appropriate frequency, with clear, atomic commits that demonstrates a clear history.
* **FAIL: Developer does not commit often, commits are overly large, poor commit messages. Drastic changes in code in a single commit.**

### 4. REPL Interface

* 4: Application's REPL goes above and beyond expectations to improve the gameplay
* **3: Application's REPL is clear and pleasant to use**
* 2: Application's REPL has some inconsistencies or rough edges
* 1: Application's REPL has enough problems as to make play difficult

### 5. Breaking Logic into Components

* 4: Application is expertly divided into logical components such that individual pieces could be reused or replaced without difficulty
* **3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart with clear intent and usage**
* 2: Application shows some effort to break logic into components, but the divisions are inconsistent or unclear
* 1: Application logic shows poor decomposition with too much logic mashed together

### 6. Functional Expectations

* 4: Application meets all requirements, and implements one extension properly.
* 3: Application meets all requirements as laid out per the specification.
* **2: Application runs, but does not work properly, or does not meet specifications.**
* 1: Application does not run, crashes on start.
