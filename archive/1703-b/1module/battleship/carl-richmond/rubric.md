Notes:

* Project REPL works up to ship placement
* Many opportunities to refactor
* Most of the work was put into ship validation
* Most structures were generated using looping techniques and not looping

### 1. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 2:  Application runs but the code has many long methods (>8 lines) and needs significant refactoring

### 2. Enumerable & Collections

* 2: Application demonstrates functional knowledge of Enumerable but only uses the most basic techniques

### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests

### 4. Git Workflow

* PASS:  Developer demonstrates mastery of git and GitHub; commits with appropriate frequency, with clear, atomic commits that demonstrates a clear history.

### 4. REPL Interface

* 3: Application's REPL is clear and pleasant to use

### 5. Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart with clear intent and usage

### 6. Functional Expectations

* 1: Application does not run, crashes on start.
