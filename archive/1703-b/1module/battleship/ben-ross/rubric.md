Notes:
* Application runs, no extenions
* REPL made sense, worked fine
* Code was well organized
* look into predicate methods to simplify conditionals
* Some minor opportunities to refacgor


### 1. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

### 2. Enumerable & Collections

* 3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of several Enumerable techniques

### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests

### 4. Git Workflow

* FAIL: Developer does not commit often, commits are overly large, poor commit messages. Drastic changes in code in a single commit.

### 4. REPL Interface

* 3: Application's REPL is clear and pleasant to use

### 5. Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart with clear intent and usage

### 6. Functional Expectations

* 3: Application meets all requirements as laid out per the specification.
