Notes:
* 19 tests
* Watch how many instance variables you are using, ask if what you are
putting in an instance variable really an attribute of that class.
* When you have an outside collector variable and you have a looping structure
modifying/adding to it, it is a sign there is a tailor made enumerable that would do the job
better
* Many long methods, that can be broken to smaller atomic methods
* missing instructions


### 1. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 2:  Application runs but the code has many long methods (>8 lines) and needs significant refactoring

### 2. Enumerable & Collections

* 2: Application demonstrates functional knowledge of Enumerable but only uses the most basic techniques

### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 1: Application does not demonstrate strong use of TDD

### 4. Git Workflow

* PASS:  Developer demonstrates mastery of git and GitHub; commits with appropriate frequency, with clear, atomic commits that demonstrates a clear history.

### 4. REPL Interface

* 3: Application's REPL is clear and pleasant to use

### 5. Breaking Logic into Components

* 1: Application logic shows poor decomposition with too much logic mashed together

### 6. Functional Expectations

* 3: Application meets all requirements as laid out per the specification.
