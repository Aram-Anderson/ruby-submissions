_Please choose the score you think you've earned in each category below. Please also describe why you feel you've earned this score for each section!_

### 1. Project Planning & Management

*   3: Developer uses an iteration map to plan project scope, breaks down broad features into granular tasks, and exercises good Git workflow (e.g., feature branches, descriptive commits, incremental PRs)

I used Waffle to plan and track my progress. I was successful in moving cards around, but I wasn't as successful in creating new cards for features I needed to work on when crunch time came down. I think I did a good job with branches and committing on git. I definitely broke the project down into granular tasks.

### 2. Completion & Pace

*   3: Developer plans stories ahead of sprint and makes some scope adjustments along the way

I'm only giving myself a 3 because I talked to Lauren ahead of time and adjusted expectations massively. I created the features we talked about and I believe I'm turning in a (mostly) solid project.

### 3. Implementation Quality

*   3: Project exhibits tested (where applicable), maintainable, and well-organized code. Developer can speak to architecture and implementation decisions

I have no tests on the front end, but I only saw 2 function I could easily write tests for. Only one of those functions was worth writing a test for. My code was refactored, but I definitely think with more time and exposure to JS I would see better ways of managing it. I think my backend could use more refactoring love in the controllers.

### 4. Application of Techniques

*   4: Developer builds project in a new language(s) or framework(s)

I used Node.js/Express on the backend and React on the frontend.

### 5. Documentation

*   3: Developer provides easy to navigate documentation showing how to setup and contribute to the application

My readmes are thorough, hilarious, and at times heartwarming. No screencasts though.

### 6. Accessibility

*   3: Developer implements code to increase accessibility

I'm mostly giving myself a 3 because I would consider this if I'd gotten more done on my app. As I build this out more next week, I'll consider accessibility to make it a better functioning app.
