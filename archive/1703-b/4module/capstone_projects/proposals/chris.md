### Project Template

### blockHouses

### Pitch

This application will use the blockchain to track the ownership and facilitate the sale of Tiny Houses.

### Problem

Tiny Houses tend to exist in a gray area as far as proving ownership and transfering the asset.  Often times, they have to be licensed as a trailor and the actual housing structure is just an 'add-on'.  People purchasing used Tiny Houses have to trust that the person selling it truly does own it and what they say about its history.

### Solution

Manufacturers will log their new Tiny Houses in the system, creating a blockchain title.  They can create a listing and set a price.  When a buyer transfers that amount of value to the manufacturer using the blockchain, the title will transfer ownership automatically to the buyer.  This will create a historical record that can be viewed for the entire life of that Tiny House.

### Target Audience

Initially, this targets Tiny House manufacturers and purchasers.  However, this could be easily adapted to regular homes and all other types of property.  Similar systems have been tried in a couple of countries, but have yet to take hold.

### New Techniques

I will be writing the blockchain software in Solidity.  Application will utilize the MEAN (Mongo Express Angular Node) stack.
