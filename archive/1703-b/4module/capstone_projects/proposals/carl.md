### Project Template

### Wakaru

### Pitch

The aim of the app is to give businesses actionable insights into the tone and language of their customer service representatives and help them interpret the information that IBM Watson provides. 

### Problem

The problems I am trying to solve are presenting trends in IBM Watson results and categorizing new inputs with statistically sound methodologies. 

### Solution

Using correlations and regression analysis, Wakaru will give determinations on new inputs. 

### Target Audience

Medium size businesses that have a growing customer service department. 

### New Techniques

I will be learning new statistical analysis, using a new API and presenting my results with a React Frontend. 

### Workflow

I will be documenting all my work in excel in a detailed report and will be using Waffle for general task management.
