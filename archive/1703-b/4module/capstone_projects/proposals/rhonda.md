### Project Template

### [Project Title]

### Pitch

This application provides a user with the option to select several cryptocurrencies in order to track their real time rates with an Amazon Alexa skill extension.

### Problem

A user will be able to access up-to-date information about the cryptocurrencies of their choice all from one place in addition to using Alexa in order to find cryptocurrency rates.

### Solution

This application will pull cryptocurrency data from a reliable API and allow the user to see the real-time rates of their favorite crypto coins in an easy-to-read, user-friendly format.

### Target Audience

Anyone who's curious about blockchain currencies. It will be accessible to users from all backgrounds.

### New Techniques

I am hoping to build this application with Vue.js and implement an Amazon Alexa skill to accompany it.

### Workflow

I will be using Pivotal Tracker to manage the progress of my project.
