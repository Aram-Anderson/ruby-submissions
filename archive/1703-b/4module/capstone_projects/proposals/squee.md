### Project Template

### Workout Tracker

### Pitch

Many of us already know what to do in the gym, but planning out our workouts can be a pain. Use workout tracker to plan your workouts in advance and maximize your time in the gym.

### Problem

When we lift weights, we want to maximize the fruits of our labor. There can be many factors that cause a gain plateau; this app aims to address 2 of those issues. First, you should always know what your workout is going to consist of before you enter the gym. Second, you should always track what weights you're moving so you can see if a program is helping.

### Solution

Workout tracker will will allow you to add workouts to days you plan to lift. You can identify lifts that will move you closer to your goals, and add them to that day. Once the workouts are added, you can add as many reps and sets as you want, plus you can set target weights. Workout tracker will then store your progress so you can compare your accomplishements over time.

### Target Audience

My app would be geared towards gym rats who already have an idea of what lifts will target each area of the body. It is not designed to be an educational app for beginners. It is to help plan workouts to move an experienced lifter along in their strength goals.

### New Techniques

I want to work with React on the front end. I think it would be cool to figure out how to enable a drag and drop for people to move lifts to specific days. Once I have base functionality of the app, I want to build a dashboard to report progress. I would like to use some charting library to show progress on the main lifts. I'll also use Node/Express on the backend.

### Workflow

I'm planning on using waffle.io as my PM tool for this project. I'll use http://ondras.zarovi.cz/sql/demo/ to plan my schema. Here's the start of my user stories: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1f8Sh_BUvTemmdgtanGTTzuBgZNU44f-IoyuyFdVK6yk/edit#gid=0
