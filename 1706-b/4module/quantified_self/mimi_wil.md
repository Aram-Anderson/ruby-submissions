## Self Assessment Rubric

Please self assess with the rubric below. Provide additional information to explain why you feel your project displays the score you've given yourself in _each_ section.

### Specification Adherence

Application implements **all** functionality as defined, but some bugs or strange behavior where features intersect.

- Above Expectations
  All project spec requirements are implemented.


### Documentation

Developer provides easy to navigate documentation showing how to setup and contribute to the application.

- Above Expectations
  Mimi did an awesome Job here.

### HTML/UI

The team put some effort into styling, and the application is not confusing to use. HTML classes and IDs are kebab case.

- Meets Expectations
  Amazing Styling by Mimi especially for exact replicating the requirements.
### Accessibility

Developer implements code to increase accessibility.


- Meets Expectations
  Consistently found ourselves using another persons created functions to achieve what we wanted.

### JS syntax and Style

JavaScript code is logically divided into files. Developers can show examples of good coding practices and demonstrate OOP concepts, like DRY and separation of concerns. Developers pay attention to indentation and naming conventions. They also consistently utilize ES5 or ES6 syntax and jQuery when working with events.


- Meets Expectations
  File organization is JS expectations but orgranized well.

### Git Workflow

The team uses master for production, uses feature branches for small groups of cards, and has a pull request for each feature with good context and conversation. Developers that aren't on the team have commented on PRs.

- Above Expectations
  Great conversation all the way around

### Project Management

The team is using a project management tool to keep their project organized and to track progress. Team is documenting conclusions and timelines on relevant cards.

- Above Expectations
  Trello for front and then created Cards for the Back-end too and was a primary reason for getting through it so fast.


### Communication

The team consistently reaches out to their Technical Lead for feedback on code quality and technical issues. The team responds to their Technical Lead in a timely manner.

- Meets Expectations
  Could have done better.
