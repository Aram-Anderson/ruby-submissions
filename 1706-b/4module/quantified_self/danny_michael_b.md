## Self Assessment Rubric

Please self assess with the rubric below. Provide additional information to explain why you feel your project displays the score you've given yourself in _each_ section.

### Specification Adherence

Application implements **all** functionality as defined, but some bugs or strange behavior where features intersect.

- Meets Expectations: Seperately the Node backend and the jQuery frontend were working to spec. When integrating there are a few bugs, such as the diary table's calories not properly updating after removing a food.

### Documentation

Developer provides easy to navigate documentation showing how to setup and contribute to the application.

- Meets Expectations: The readme files describe what language the apps were built in and how to install them. API has the endpoints listed.

### HTML/UI

The team put some effort into styling, and the application is not confusing to use. HTML classes and IDs are kebab case.

- Above Expectations: HTML syntax and formatting was consistent through the project.  

### Accessibility

Developer implements code to increase accessibility.

- Meets Expectations: Didn't use any spans, the colors are not confusing to look at. Some of the elements are named.

### JS syntax and Style

JavaScript code is logically divided into files. Developers can show examples of good coding practices and demonstrate OOP concepts, like DRY and separation of concerns. Developers pay attention to indentation and naming conventions. They also consistently utilize ES5 or ES6 syntax and jQuery when working with events.

- Meets Expectations: The formatting and syntax of the JS is consistent and ES6 was very consistenly used. Naming conventions were properly implemented. 

### Git Workflow

The team uses master for production, uses feature branches for small groups of cards, and has a pull request for each feature with good context and conversation. Developers that aren't on the team have commented on PRs.

- Meets Expectations: Master was being continuously deployed, PRs were always reviewed before merging.

### Project Management

The team is using a project management tool to keep their project organized and to track progress. Team is documenting conclusions and timelines on relevant cards.

- Meets Expectations: Used waffle cards to drive the development of the larger frontend project.

### Communication

The team consistently reaches out to their Technical Lead for feedback on code quality and technical issues. The team responds to their Technical Lead in a timely manner.

- Meets Expectations: Lauren reached out to us a lot during the project to check on how we were doing, we were always quick to respond with where we were at. Did not reach out through pull requests, but did come to you with questions when we were running into issues.
